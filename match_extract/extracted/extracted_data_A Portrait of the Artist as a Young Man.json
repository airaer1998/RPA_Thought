      "text": "down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road \n\n met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo \n\n  \n\n His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a \n\n glass: he had a hairy face. \n\n  \n\n He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne \n\n lived: she sold lemon platt. \n\n  \n\n  O, the wild rose blossoms \n\n  On the little green place. \n\n  \n\n He sang that song. That was his song. \n\n  \n\n  O, the green wothe botheth. \n\n  \n\n When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets cold. His mother put \n\n on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell. \n\n  \n\n His mother had a nicer smell than his father. She played on the piano \n\n the sailor's hornpipe for him to dance. He danced: \n\n  \n\n  Tralala lala, \n\n  Tralala tralaladdy, \n\n  Tralala lala, \n\n  Tralala lala. \n\n  \n\n Uncle Charles and Dante clapped. They were older than his father and \n\n mother but uncle Charles was older than Dante. \n\n  \n\n Dante had two brushes in her press. The brush with the maroon velvet \n\n back was for Michael Davitt and the brush with the green velvet back \n\n was for Parnell. Dante gave him a cachou every time he brought her a \n\n piece of tissue paper. \n\n  \n\n The Vances lived in number seven. They had a different father and \n\n mother. They were Eileen's father and mother. When they were grown up \n\n he was going to marry Eileen. He hid under the table. His mother said: \n\n  \n\n --O, Stephen will apologize. \n\n  \n\n Dante said: \n\n  \n\n --O, if not, the eagles will come and pull out his eyes.-- \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Pull out his eyes, \n\n  Apologize, \n\n  Apologize, \n\n  Pull out his eyes. \n\n  Apologize, \n\n  Pull out his eyes, \n\n  Pull out his eyes, \n\n  Apologize. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the \n\n prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and \n\n chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy \n\n leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light. He kept on \n\n the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach \n\n of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small \n\n and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and \n\n watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the \n\n third line all the fellows said. \n\n  \n\n Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink. Rody \n\n Kickham had greaves in his number and a hamper in the refectory. Nasty \n\n Roche had big hands. He called the Friday pudding dog-in-the-blanket. \n\n And one day be had asked: \n\n  \n\n --What is your name? \n\n  \n\n Stephen had answered: Stephen Dedalus. \n\n  \n\n Then Nasty Roche had said: \n\n  \n\n --What kind of a name is that? \n\n  \n\n And when Stephen had not been able to answer Nasty Roche had asked: \n\n  \n\n --What is your father? \n\n  \n\n Stephen had answered: \n\n  \n\n --A gentleman. \n\n  \n\n Then Nasty Roche had asked: \n\n  \n\n --Is he a magistrate? \n\n  \n\n He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making \n\n little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with cold. He kept \n\n his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt \n\n round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a \n\n fellow said to Cantwell: \n\n  \n\n --I'd give you such a belt in a second. \n\n  \n\n Cantwell had answered: \n\n  \n\n --Go and fight your match. Give Cecil Thunder a belt. I'd like to see \n\n you. He'd give you a toe in the rump for yourself. \n\n  \n\n That was not a nice expression. His mother had told him not to speak \n\n with the rough boys in the college. Nice mother! The first day in the \n\n hall of the castle when she had said goodbye she had put up her veil \n\n double to her nose to kiss him: and her nose and eyes were red. But he \n\n had pretended not to see that she was going to cry. She was a nice \n\n mother but she was not so nice when she cried. And his father had given \n\n him two five-shilling pieces for pocket money. And his father had told \n\n him if he wanted anything to write home to him and, whatever he did, \n\n never to peach on a fellow. Then at the door of the castle the rector \n\n had shaken hands with his father and mother, his soutane fluttering in \n\n the breeze, and the car had driven off with his father and mother on \n\n it. They had cried to him from the car, waving their hands: \n\n  \n\n --Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! \n\n  \n\n --Goodbye, Stephen, goodbye! \n\n  \n\n He was caught in the whirl of a scrimmage and, fearful of the flashing \n\n eyes and muddy boots, bent down to look through the legs. The fellows \n\n were struggling and groaning and their legs were rubbing and kicking \n\n and stamping. Then Jack Lawton's yellow boots dodged out the ball and \n\n all the other boots and legs ran after. He ran after them a little way \n\n and then stopped. It was useless to run on. Soon they would be going \n\n home for the holidays. After supper in the study hall he would change \n\n the number pasted up inside his desk from seventy-seven to seventy-six. \n\n  \n\n It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold. \n\n The sky was pale and cold but there were lights in the castle. He \n\n wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the \n\n ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One \n\n day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the \n\n marks of the soldiers' slugs in the wood of the door and had given him \n\n a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to \n\n see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps \n\n Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor \n\n Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only \n\n sentences to learn the spelling from. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Wolsey died in Leicester Abbey \n\n  Where the abbots buried him. \n\n  Canker is a disease of plants, \n\n  Cancer one of animals. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his \n\n head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he \n\n had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder \n\n him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff \n\n box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How \n\n cold and slimy the water had been! A fellow had once seen a big rat \n\n jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting \n\n for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her \n\n jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! \n\n Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique \n\n Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the \n\n name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than \n\n Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles \n\n said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman. And when \n\n Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her \n\n mouth: that was heartburn. \n\n  \n\n A voice cried far out on the playground: \n\n  \n\n --All in! \n\n  \n\n Then other voices cried from the lower and third lines: \n\n  \n\n --All in! All in! \n\n  \n\n The players closed around, flushed and muddy, and he went among them, \n\n glad to go in. Rody Kickham held the ball by its greasy lace. A fellow \n\n asked him to give it one last: but he walked on without even answering \n\n the fellow. Simon Moonan told him not to because the prefect was \n\n looking. The fellow turned to Simon Moonan and said: \n\n  \n\n --We all know why you speak. You are McGlade's suck. \n\n  \n\n Suck was a queer word. The fellow called Simon Moonan that name because \n\n Simon Moonan used to tie the prefect's false sleeves behind his back \n\n and the prefect used to let on to be angry. But the sound was ugly. \n\n Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and \n\n his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water \n\n went down through the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down \n\n slowly the hole in the basin had made a sound like that: suck. Only \n\n louder. \n\n  \n\n To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel cold \n\n and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: \n\n cold and hot. He felt cold and then a little hot: and he could see the \n\n names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing. \n\n  \n\n And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish. \n\n But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a light noise like \n\n a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in \n\n the playroom you could hear it. \n\n  \n\n It was the hour for sums. Father Arnall wrote a hard sum on the board \n\n and then said: \n\n  \n\n --Now then, who will win? Go ahead, York! Go ahead, Lancaster! \n\n  \n\n Stephen tried his best, but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. \n\n The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the \n\n breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums, but he \n\n tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall's face looked \n\n very black, but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton \n\n cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said: \n\n  \n\n --Right. Bravo Lancaster! The red rose wins. Come on now, York! Forge \n\n ahead! \n\n  \n\n Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the \n\n red rose on it looked very rich because he had a blue sailor top on. \n\n Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who \n\n would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack \n\n Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. \n\n His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next \n\n sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away \n\n and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white \n\n because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum \n\n but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful \n\n colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and \n\n third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. \n\n Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a \n\n wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about \n\n the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not \n\n have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could. \n\n  \n\n The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and \n\n along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two \n\n prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The \n\n tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which \n\n the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He \n\n wondered whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white \n\n things were cold and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that \n\n their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; \n\n that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said. \n\n  \n\n All the boys seemed to him very strange. They had all fathers and \n\n mothers and different clothes and voices. He longed to be at home and \n\n lay his head on his mother's lap. But he could not: and so he longed \n\n for the play and study and prayers to be over and to be in bed. \n\n  \n\n He drank another cup of hot tea and Fleming said: \n\n  \n\n --What's up? Have you a pain or what's up with you? \n\n  \n\n --I don't know, Stephen said. \n\n  \n\n --Sick in your breadbasket, Fleming said, because your face looks \n\n white. It will go away. \n\n  \n\n --O yes, Stephen said. \n\n  \n\n But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if \n\n you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He \n\n wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened \n\n the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every \n\n time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at \n\n night. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train \n\n going into a tunnel. That night at Dalkey the train had roared like \n\n that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He \n\n closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; \n\n roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then \n\n roar out of the tunnel again and then stop. \n\n  \n\n Then the higher line fellows began to come down along the matting in \n\n the middle of the refectory, Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the \n\n Spaniard who was allowed to smoke cigars and the little Portuguese who \n\n wore the woolly cap. And then the lower line tables and the tables of \n\n the third line. And every single fellow had a different way of walking. \n\n  \n\n He sat in a corner of the playroom pretending to watch a game of \n\n dominoes and once or twice he was able to hear for an instant the \n\n little song of the gas. The prefect was at the door with some boys and \n\n Simon Moonan was knotting his false sleeves. He was telling them \n\n something about Tullabeg. \n\n  \n\n Then he went away from the door and Wells came over to Stephen and \n\n said: \n\n  \n\n --Tell us, Dedalus, do you kiss your mother before you go to bed? \n\n  \n\n Stephen answered: \n\n  \n\n --I do. \n\n  \n\n Wells turned to the other fellows and said: \n\n  \n\n --O, I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every night \n\n before he goes to bed. \n\n  \n\n The other fellows stopped their game and turned round, laughing. \n\n Stephen blushed under their eyes and said: \n\n  \n\n --I do not. \n\n  \n\n Wells said: \n\n  \n\n --O, I say, here's a fellow says he doesn't kiss his mother before he \n\n goes to bed. \n\n  \n\n They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his \n\n whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to \n\n the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must \n\n know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think \n\n of Wells's mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's \n\n face. He did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him \n\n into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his \n\n little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror \n\n of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And \n\n how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big \n\n rat jump plop into the scum. \n\n  \n\n The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell \n\n rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the \n\n cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still \n\n tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his \n\n mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You \n\n put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put \n\n her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; \n\n her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny \n\n little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces? \n\n  \n\n Sitting in the study hall he opened the lid of his desk and changed the \n\n number pasted up inside from seventy-seven to seventy-six. But the \n\n Christmas vacation was very far away: but one time it would come \n\n because the earth moved round always. \n\n  \n\n There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a \n\n big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one \n\n night during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds \n\n maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with \n\n the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet \n\n back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them \n\n those colours. Fleming had done it himself. \n\n  \n\n He opened the geography to study the lesson; but he could not learn the \n\n names of places in America. Still they were all different places that \n\n had different names. They were all in different countries and the \n\n countries were in continents and the continents were in the world and \n\n the world was in the universe. \n\n  \n\n He turned to the flyleaf of the geography and read what he had written \n\n there: himself, his name and where he was. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Stephen Dedalus \n\n  Class of Elements \n\n  Clongowes Wood College \n\n  Sallins \n\n  County Kildare \n\n  Ireland \n\n  Europe \n\n  The World \n\n  The Universe \n\n  \n\n  \n\n That was in his writing: and Fleming one night for a cod had written on \n\n the opposite page: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Stephen Dedalus is my name, \n\n  Ireland is my nation. \n\n  Clongowes is my dwellingplace \n\n  And heaven my expectation. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n He read the verses backwards but then they were not poetry. Then he \n\n read the flyleaf from the bottom to the top till he came to his own \n\n name. That was he: and he read down the page again. What was after the \n\n universe? \n\n  \n\n Nothing. But was there anything round the universe to show where it \n\n stopped before the nothing place began? \n\n  \n\n It could not be a wall; but there could be a thin thin line there all \n\n round everything. It was very big to think about everything and \n\n everywhere. Only God could do that. He tried to think what a big \n\n thought that must be; but he could only think of God. God was God's \n\n name just as his name was Stephen. DIEU was the French for God and that \n\n was God's name too; and when anyone prayed to God and said DIEU then \n\n God knew at once that it was a French person that was praying. But, \n\n though there were different names for God in all the different \n\n languages in the world and God understood what all the people who \n\n prayed said in their different languages, still God remained always the \n\n same God and God's real name was God. \n\n  \n\n It made him very tired to think that way. It made him feel his head \n\n very big. He turned over the flyleaf and looked wearily at the green \n\n round earth in the middle of the maroon clouds. He wondered which was \n\n right, to be for the green or for the maroon, because Dante had ripped \n\n the green velvet back off the brush that was for Parnell one day with \n\n her scissors and had told him that Parnell was a bad man. He wondered \n\n if they were arguing at home about that. That was called politics. \n\n There were two sides in it: Dante was on one side and his father and Mr \n\n Casey were on the other side but his mother and uncle Charles were on \n\n no side. Every day there was something in the paper about it. \n\n  \n\n It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he \n\n did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When \n\n would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big \n\n voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far \n\n away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation \n\n again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was \n\n like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of \n\n the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps \n\n of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it \n\n was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel \n\n and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after \n\n the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He \n\n shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and \n\n then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night \n\n prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be \n\n lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold \n\n shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so \n\n warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn. \n\n  \n\n The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall \n\n after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the \n\n chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit. \n\n Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was cold night air in the \n\n chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea \n\n was cold day and night: but it was colder at night. It was cold and \n\n dark under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would \n\n be on the hob to make punch. \n\n  \n\n The prefect of the chapel prayed above his head and his memory knew the \n\n responses: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  O Lord open our lips \n\n  And our mouths shall announce Thy praise. \n\n  Incline unto our aid, O God! \n\n  O Lord make haste to help us! \n\n  \n\n  \n\n There was a cold night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It \n\n was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the \n\n chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and \n\n corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him On \n\n his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: \n\n there were little cottages there and he had seen a \n\n woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms \n\n as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for \n\n one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark \n\n lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, \n\n air and rain and turf and corduroy. But O, the road there between the \n\n trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to \n\n think of how it was. \n\n  \n\n He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last \n\n prayers. He prayed it too against the dark outside under the trees. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n VISIT, WE BESEECH THEE, O LORD, THIS HABITATION AND DRIVE \n\n AWAY FROM IT ALL THE SNARES OF THE ENEMY. MAY THY HOLY \n\n ANGELS DWELL HEREIN TO PRESERVE US IN PEACE AND MAY THY \n\n BLESSINGS BE ALWAYS UPON US THROUGH CHRIST OUR LORD. \n\n AMEN. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n His fingers trembled as he undressed himself in the dormitory. He told \n\n his fingers to hurry up. He had to undress and then kneel and say his \n\n own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might \n\n not go to hell when he died. He rolled his stockings off and put on his \n\n nightshirt quickly and knelt trembling at his bedside and repeated his \n\n prayers quickly, fearing that the gas would go down. He felt his \n\n shoulders shaking as he murmured: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  God bless my father and my mother and spare them to me! \n\n  God bless my little brothers and sisters and spare them to me! \n\n  God bless Dante and Uncle Charles and spare them to me! \n\n  \n\n  \n\n He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of \n\n the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold \n\n white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when \n\n he died; and the shaking would stop. A voice bade the boys in the \n\n dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet \n\n and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off \n\n on all sides. The light was lowered quietly. \n\n  \n\n The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase and along the \n\n corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the dark. Was it true about \n\n the black dog that walked there at night with eyes as big as \n\n carriage-lamps? They said it was the ghost of a murderer. A long shiver \n\n of fear flowed over his body. He saw the dark entrance hall of the \n\n castle. Old servants in old dress were in the ironing-room above the \n\n staircase. It was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a \n\n fire there, but the hall was still dark. A figure came up the staircase \n\n from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale \n\n and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of \n\n strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw their \n\n master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his death-wound. \n\n But only the dark was where they looked: only dark silent air. Their \n\n master had received his death-wound on the battlefield of Prague far \n\n away over the sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed \n\n to his side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak \n\n of a marshal. \n\n  \n\n O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the dark was cold \n\n and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like \n\n carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of \n\n marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away \n\n over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so \n\n strange? \n\n  \n\n  \n\n VISIT, WE BESEECH THEE, O LORD, THIS HABITATION AND DRIVE AWAY FROM IT \n\n ALL... \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Going home for the holidays! That would be lovely: the fellows had told \n\n him. Getting up on the cars in the early wintry morning outside the \n\n door of the castle. The cars were rolling on the gravel. Cheers for the \n\n rector! \n\n  \n\n Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! \n\n  \n\n The cars drove past the chapel and all caps were raised. They drove \n\n merrily along the country roads. The drivers pointed with their whips \n\n to Bodenstown. The fellows cheered. They passed the farmhouse \n\n of the Jolly Farmer. Cheer after cheer after cheer. Through Clane they \n\n drove, cheering and cheered. The peasant women stood at the half-doors, \n\n the men stood here and there. The lovely smell there was in the wintry \n\n air: the smell of Clane: rain and wintry air and turf smouldering and \n\n corduroy. \n\n  \n\n The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream \n\n facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking, \n\n unlocking the doors. They were men in dark blue and silver; they had \n\n silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music: click, click: \n\n click, click. \n\n  \n\n And the train raced on over the flat lands and past the Hill of Allen. \n\n The telegraph poles were passing, passing. The train went on and on. It \n\n knew. There were lanterns in the hall of his father's house and ropes \n\n of green branches. There were holly and ivy round the pierglass and \n\n holly and ivy, green and red, twined round the chandeliers. There were \n\n red holly and green ivy round the old portraits on the walls. Holly and \n\n ivy for him and for Christmas. \n\n  \n\n Lovely... \n\n  \n\n All the people. Welcome home, Stephen! Noises of welcome. His mother \n\n kissed him. Was that right? His father was a marshal now: higher than a \n\n magistrate. Welcome home, Stephen! \n\n  \n\n Noises... \n\n  \n\n There was a noise of curtain-rings running back along the rods, of \n\n water being splashed in the basins. There was a noise of rising and \n\n dressing and washing in the dormitory: a noise of clapping of hands as \n\n the prefect went up and down telling the fellows to look sharp. A pale \n\n sunlight showed the yellow curtains drawn back, the tossed beds. His \n\n bed was very hot and his face and body were very hot. \n\n  \n\n He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He tried to pull \n\n on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The sunlight was queer and \n\n cold. \n\n  \n\n Fleming said: \n\n  \n\n --Are you not well? \n\n  \n\n He did not know; and Fleming said: \n\n  \n\n --Get back into bed. I'll tell McGlade you're not well. \n\n  \n\n --He's sick. \n\n  \n\n --Who is? \n\n  \n\n --Tell McGlade. \n\n  \n\n --Get back into bed. \n\n  \n\n --Is he sick? \n\n  \n\n A fellow held his arms while he loosened the stocking clinging to his \n\n foot and climbed back into the hot bed. \n\n  \n\n He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid glow. He heard \n\n the fellows talk among themselves about him as they dressed for mass. \n\n It was a mean thing to do, to shoulder him into the square ditch, they \n\n were saying.--Then their voices ceased; they had gone. A voice at his \n\n bed said: \n\n  \n\n --Dedalus, don't spy on us, sure you won't? \n\n  \n\n Wells's face was there. He looked at it and saw that Wells was afraid. \n\n  \n\n --I didn't mean to. Sure you won't? \n\n  \n\n His father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow. \n\n He shook his head and answered no and felt glad. \n\n  \n\n Wells said: \n\n  \n\n --I didn't mean to, honour bright. It was only for cod. I'm sorry. \n\n  \n\n The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was afraid. Afraid \n\n that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one \n\n of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on \n\n the playgrounds in the evening light, creeping from point to point on \n\n the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey light. \n\n Leicester Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him \n\n themselves. \n\n  \n\n It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, \n\n no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's \n\n hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against \n\n the prefect's cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and \n\n damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy \n\n coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look \n\n out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could \n\n not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their \n\n sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things. \n\n  \n\n The prefect was there again and it was his voice that was saying that \n\n he was to get up, that Father Minister had said he was to get up and \n\n dress and go to the infirmary. And while he was dressing himself as \n\n quickly as he could the prefect said: \n\n  \n\n --We must pack off to Brother Michael because we have the \n\n collywobbles! \n\n  \n\n He was very decent to say that. That was all to make him laugh. But he \n\n could not laugh because his cheeks and lips were all shivery: and then \n\n the prefect had to laugh by himself. \n\n  \n\n The prefect cried: \n\n  \n\n --Quick march! Hayfoot! Strawfoot! \n\n  \n\n They went together down the staircase and along the corridor and past \n\n the bath. As he passed the door he remembered with a vague fear the \n\n warm turf-coloured bogwater, the warm moist air, the noise of plunges, \n\n the smell of the towels, like medicine. \n\n  \n\n Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the \n\n door of the dark cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine. That \n\n came from the bottles on the shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother \n\n Michael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had \n\n reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he \n\n would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him \n\n sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was he \n\n not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others? \n\n  \n\n There were two beds in the room and in one bed there was a fellow: and \n\n when they went in he called out: \n\n  \n\n --Hello! It's young Dedalus! What's up? \n\n  \n\n --The sky is up, Brother Michael said. \n\n  \n\n He was a fellow out of the third of grammar and, while Stephen was \n\n undressing, he asked Brother Michael to bring him a round of buttered \n\n toast. \n\n  \n\n --Ah, do! he said. \n\n  \n\n --Butter you up! said Brother Michael. You'll get your walking papers \n\n in the morning when the doctor comes. \n\n  \n\n --Will I? the fellow said. I'm not well yet. \n\n  \n\n Brother Michael repeated: \n\n  \n\n --You'll get your walking papers. I tell you. \n\n  \n\n He bent down to rake the fire. He had a long back like the long back of \n\n a tramhorse. He shook the poker gravely and nodded his head at the \n\n fellow out of third of grammar. \n\n  \n\n Then Brother Michael went away and after a while the fellow out of \n\n third of grammar turned in towards the wall and fell asleep. \n\n  \n\n That was the infirmary. He was sick then. Had they written home to tell \n\n his mother and father? But it would be quicker for one of the priests \n\n to go himself to tell them. Or he would write a letter for the priest \n\n to bring. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Dear Mother, \n\n  \n\n  I am sick. I want to go home. Please come and take me home. \n\n  I am in the infirmary. \n\n  \n\n  Your fond son, \n\n  Stephen \n\n  \n\n  \n\n How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He \n\n wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. \n\n He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in \n\n the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had \n\n died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with \n\n sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. \n\n The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would \n\n be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they \n\n would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried \n\n in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. \n\n And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would \n\n toll slowly. \n\n  \n\n He could hear the tolling. He said over to himself the song that Brigid \n\n had taught him. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  Dingdong! The castle bell! \n\n  Farewell, my mother! \n\n  Bury me in the old churchyard \n\n  Beside my eldest brother. \n\n  My coffin shall be black, \n\n  Six angels at my back, \n\n  Two to sing and two to pray \n\n  And two to carry my soul away. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n How beautiful and sad that was! How beautiful the words were where they \n\n said BURY ME IN THE OLD CHURCHYARD! A tremor passed over his body. How \n\n sad and how beautiful! He wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: \n\n for the words, so beautiful and sad, like music. The bell! The bell! \n\n Farewell! O farewell! \n\n  \n\n The cold sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his \n\n bedside with a bowl of beef-tea. He was glad for his mouth was hot and \n\n dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds.",

      "text": "The fellows talked together in little groups. \n\n  \n\n One fellow said: \n\n  \n\n --They were caught near the Hill of Lyons. \n\n  \n\n --Who caught them? \n\n  \n\n --Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. The same fellow \n\n added: \n\n  \n\n --A fellow in the higher line told me. \n\n  \n\n Fleming asked: \n\n  \n\n --But why did they run away, tell us? \n\n  \n\n --I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked cash out of \n\n the rector's room. \n\n  \n\n --Who fecked it? \n\n  \n\n --Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. \n\n  \n\n --But that was stealing. How could they have done that? \n\n  \n\n --A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know why they \n\n scut. \n\n  \n\n --Tell us why. \n\n  \n\n --I was told not to, Wells said. \n\n  \n\n --O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it out. \n\n  \n\n Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round to see if \n\n anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: \n\n  \n\n --You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy? \n\n  \n\n --Yes. \n\n  \n\n --Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell. \n\n And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. \n\n  \n\n And the fellow who had spoken first said: \n\n  \n\n --Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher line. \n\n  \n\n The fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, \n\n listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they \n\n have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark \n\n wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It \n\n was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was \n\n a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be \n\n dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little \n\n altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held the \n\n censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals \n\n lighting. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the \n\n fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And \n\n then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the \n\n rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had \n\n hissed on the red coals. \n\n  \n\n The fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on \n\n the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller: that \n\n was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow \n\n out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow's machine \n\n lightly on the cinder path and his spectacles had been broken in three \n\n pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone Into his mouth. \n\n  \n\n That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the \n\n goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up. But there \n\n was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some \n\n said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And \n\n all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling \n\n twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the \n\n cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, pock, \n\n puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the \n\n brimming bowl. \n\n  \n\n Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: \n\n  \n\n --You are all wrong. \n\n  \n\n All turned towards him eagerly. \n\n  \n\n --Why? \n\n  \n\n --Do you know? \n\n  \n\n --Who told you? \n\n  \n\n --Tell us, Athy. \n\n  \n\n Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking by \n\n himself kicking a stone before him. \n\n  \n\n --Ask him, he said. \n\n  \n\n The fellows looked there and then said: \n\n  \n\n --Why him? \n\n  \n\n --Is he in it? \n\n  \n\n Athy lowered his voice and said: \n\n  \n\n --Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you must not \n\n let on you know. \n\n  \n\n --Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. \n\n  \n\n He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: \n\n  \n\n --They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one \n\n night. \n\n  \n\n The fellows looked at him and asked: \n\n  \n\n --Caught? \n\n  \n\n --What doing? \n\n  \n\n Athy said: \n\n  \n\n --Smugging. \n\n  \n\n All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: \n\n  \n\n --And that's why. \n\n  \n\n Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking \n\n across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did \n\n that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows \n\n out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. \n\n Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of \n\n creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down \n\n to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at \n\n the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; \n",

      "text": "The fellows talked together in little groups. \n\n  \n\n One fellow said: \n\n  \n\n --They were caught near the Hill of Lyons. \n\n  \n\n --Who caught them? \n\n  \n\n --Mr Gleeson and the minister. They were on a car. The same fellow \n\n added: \n\n  \n\n --A fellow in the higher line told me. \n\n  \n\n Fleming asked: \n\n  \n\n --But why did they run away, tell us? \n\n  \n\n --I know why, Cecil Thunder said. Because they had fecked cash out of \n\n the rector's room. \n\n  \n\n --Who fecked it? \n\n  \n\n --Kickham's brother. And they all went shares in it. \n\n  \n\n --But that was stealing. How could they have done that? \n\n  \n\n --A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! Wells said. I know why they \n\n scut. \n\n  \n\n --Tell us why. \n\n  \n\n --I was told not to, Wells said. \n\n  \n\n --O, go on, Wells, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it out. \n\n  \n\n Stephen bent forward his head to hear. Wells looked round to see if \n\n anyone was coming. Then he said secretly: \n\n  \n\n --You know the altar wine they keep in the press in the sacristy? \n\n  \n\n --Yes. \n\n  \n\n --Well, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell. \n\n And that's why they ran away, if you want to know. \n\n  \n\n And the fellow who had spoken first said: \n\n  \n\n --Yes, that's what I heard too from the fellow in the higher line. \n\n  \n\n The fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, \n\n listening. A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they \n\n have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark \n\n wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It \n\n was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was \n\n a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be \n\n dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little \n\n altar in the wood. A strange and holy place. The boy that held the \n\n censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals \n\n lighting. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the \n\n fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And \n\n then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the \n\n rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had \n\n hissed on the red coals. \n\n  \n\n The fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on \n\n the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller: that \n\n was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow \n\n out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow's machine \n\n lightly on the cinder path and his spectacles had been broken in three \n\n pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone Into his mouth. \n\n  \n\n That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the \n\n goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up. But there \n\n was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some \n\n said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And \n\n all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling \n\n twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the \n\n cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, pock, \n\n puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly falling in the \n\n brimming bowl. \n\n  \n\n Athy, who had been silent, said quietly: \n\n  \n\n --You are all wrong. \n\n  \n\n All turned towards him eagerly. \n\n  \n\n --Why? \n\n  \n\n --Do you know? \n\n  \n\n --Who told you? \n\n  \n\n --Tell us, Athy. \n\n  \n\n Athy pointed across the playground to where Simon Moonan was walking by \n\n himself kicking a stone before him. \n\n  \n\n --Ask him, he said. \n\n  \n\n The fellows looked there and then said: \n\n  \n\n --Why him? \n\n  \n\n --Is he in it? \n\n  \n\n Athy lowered his voice and said: \n\n  \n\n --Do you know why those fellows scut? I will tell you but you must not \n\n let on you know. \n\n  \n\n --Tell us, Athy. Go on. You might if you know. \n\n  \n\n He paused for a moment and then said mysteriously: \n\n  \n\n --They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one \n\n night. \n\n  \n\n The fellows looked at him and asked: \n\n  \n\n --Caught? \n\n  \n\n --What doing? \n\n  \n\n Athy said: \n\n  \n\n --Smugging. \n\n  \n\n All the fellows were silent: and Athy said: \n\n  \n\n --And that's why. \n\n  \n\n Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking \n\n across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did \n\n that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows \n\n out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. \n\n Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of \n\n creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down \n\n to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at \n\n the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; \n\n and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened \n\n and it was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that \n\n art elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he \n\n was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because \n\n he was always at his nails, paring them. \n\n  \n\n Eileen had long thin cool white hands too because she was a girl. They \n\n were like ivory; only soft. That was the meaning of TOWER OF IVORY but \n\n protestants could not understand it and made fun of it. One day he had \n\n stood beside her looking into the hotel grounds. A waiter was running \n\n up a trail of bunting on the flagstaff and a fox terrier was scampering \n\n to and fro on the sunny lawn. She had put her hand into his pocket \n\n where his hand was and he had felt how cool and thin and soft her hand \n\n was. She had said that pockets were funny things to have: and then all \n\n of a sudden she had broken away and had run laughing down the sloping \n\n curve of the path. Her fair hair had streamed out behind her like gold \n\n in the sun. TOWER OF IVORY. HOUSE OF GOLD. By thinking of things you \n\n could understand them. \n\n  \n\n But why in the square? You went there when you wanted to do something. \n\n It was all thick slabs of slate and water trickled all day out of tiny \n\n pinholes and there was a queer smell of stale water there. And behind \n\n the door of one of the closets there was a drawing in red pencil of a \n\n bearded man in a Roman dress with a brick in each hand and underneath \n\n was the name of the drawing: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Balbus was building a wall. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Some fellow had drawn it there for a cod. It had a funny face but it \n\n was very like a man with a beard. And on the wall of another closet \n\n there was written in backhand in beautiful writing: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Julius Caesar wrote The Calico Belly. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Perhaps that was why they were there because it was a place where some \n\n fellows wrote things for cod. But all the same it was queer what Athy \n\n said and the way he said it. It was not a cod because they had run \n\n away. He looked with the others across the playground and began to feel \n\n afraid. \n\n  \n\n At last Fleming said: \n\n  \n\n --And we are all to be punished for what other fellows did? \n\n  \n\n -- \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n I won't come back, see if I do, Cecil Thunder said. Three days' silence \n\n in the refectory and sending us up for six and eight every minute. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, said Wells. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting the note \n\n so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how many ferulae you \n\n are to get. I won't come back too. \n\n  \n\n Yes, said Cecil Thunder, and the prefect of studies was in second of \n\n grammar this morning. \n\n  \n\n --Let us get up a rebellion, Fleming said. Will we? \n\n  \n\n All the fellows were silent. The air was very silent and you could hear \n\n the cricket bats but more slowly than before: pick, pock. \n\n  \n\n Wells asked: \n\n  \n\n --What is going to be done to them? \n\n  \n\n --Simon Moonan and Tusker are going to be flogged, Athy said, and the \n\n fellows in the higher line got their choice of flogging or being \n\n expelled. \n\n  \n\n --And which are they taking? asked the fellow who had spoken first. \n\n  \n\n --All are taking expulsion except Corrigan, Athy answered. He's going \n\n to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. \n\n  \n\n --I know why, Cecil Thunder said. He is right and the other fellows \n\n are wrong because a flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that \n\n has been expelled from college is known all his life on account of it. \n\n Besides Gleeson won't flog him hard. \n\n  \n\n --It's best of his play not to, Fleming said. \n\n  \n\n --I wouldn't like to be Simon Moonan and Tusker Cecil Thunder said. \n\n But I don't believe they will be flogged. Perhaps they will be sent up \n\n for twice nine. \n\n  \n\n --No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. Wells \n\n rubbed himself and said in a crying voice: \n\n  \n\n --Please, sir, let me off! \n\n  \n\n Athy grinned and turned up the sleeves of his jacket, saying: \n\n  \n\n  It can't be helped; \n\n  It must be done. \n\n  So down with your breeches \n\n  And out with your bum. \n\n  \n\n The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. In the \n\n silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and \n\n from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you \n\n would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The \n\n fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and \n\n he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of \n\n sounds. A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he \n\n wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it \n\n and cold: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? \n\n It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver \n\n when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you \n\n undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, the master or \n\n the boy himself. O how could they laugh about it that way? \n\n  \n\n He looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had \n\n rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. \n\n But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish \n\n white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he \n\n pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed \n\n nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were \n\n not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to \n\n think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane \n\n and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed \n\n yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think \n\n of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle. And he thought of \n\n what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. \n\n And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not \n\n to. But that was not why \n\n  \n\n A voice from far out on the playground cried: \n\n  \n\n --All in! \n\n  \n\n And other voices cried: \n\n  \n\n --All in! All in! \n\n  \n\n During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listening to the \n\n slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and fro making little \n\n signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him \n\n how to hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for himself \n\n though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book. \n\n Zeal WITHOUT PRUDENCE IS LIKE A SHIP ADRIFT. But the lines of the \n\n letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his \n\n right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out \n\n the full curves of the capital. \n\n  \n\n But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other \n\n masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what \n\n fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some \n\n of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been \n\n found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a \n\n monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been \n\n a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press \n\n and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar \n\n in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense \n\n went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and \n\n Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was \n\n not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and \n\n a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a \n\n terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence \n\n when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the \n\n press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not \n\n terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account \n\n of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first \n\n holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth \n\n and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down \n\n to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the \n\n rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: \n\n wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark \n\n purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the \n\n faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on \n\n the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was \n\n the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked \n\n Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would \n\n say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. \n\n But he said: \n\n  \n\n --Gentlemen, the happiest day of my life was the day on which I made \n\n my first holy communion. \n\n  \n\n Father Arnall came in and the Latin lesson began and he remained still, \n\n leaning on the desk with his arms folded. Father Arnall gave out the \n\n theme-books and he said that they were scandalous and that they were \n\n all to be written out again with the corrections at once. But the worst \n\n of all was Fleming's theme because the pages were stuck together by a \n\n blot: and Father Arnall held it up by a corner and said it was an \n\n insult to any master to send him up such a theme. Then he asked Jack \n\n Lawton to decline the noun MARE and Jack Lawton stopped at the ablative \n\n singular and could not go on with the plural. \n\n  \n\n --You should be ashamed of yourself, said Father Arnall sternly. You, \n\n the leader of the class! \n\n  \n\n Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. Nobody knew. \n\n Father Arnall became very quiet, more and more quiet as each boy tried \n\n to answer it and could not. But his face was black-looking and \n\n his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked \n\n Fleming and Fleming said that the word had no plural. Father Arnall \n\n suddenly shut the book and shouted at him: \n\n  \n\n --Kneel out there in the middle of the class. You are one of the \n\n idlest boys I ever met. Copy out your themes again the rest of you. \n\n  \n\n Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last \n\n benches. The other boys bent over their theme-books and began to write. \n\n A silence filled the classroom and Stephen, glancing timidly at Father \n\n Arnall's dark face, saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in. \n\n  \n\n Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to \n\n get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study \n\n better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was \n\n allowed, because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do \n\n it. But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to \n\n confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if \n\n the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the \n\n provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was \n\n called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all \n\n clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if \n\n they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and \n\n Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson \n\n would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think \n\n what because you would have to think of them in a different way with \n\n different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches \n\n and different kinds of hats. \n\n  \n\n The door opened quietly and closed. A quick whisper ran through the \n\n class: the prefect of studies. There was an instant of dead silence and \n\n then the loud crack of a pandybat on the last desk. Stephen's heart \n\n leapt up in fear. \n\n  \n\n --Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the prefect of \n\n studies. Any lazy idle loafers that want flogging in this class? \n\n  \n\n He came to the middle of the class and saw Fleming on his knees. \n\n  \n\n --Hoho! he cried. Who is this boy? Why is he on his knees? What is \n\n your name, boy? \n\n  \n\n --Fleming, sir. \n\n  \n\n --Hoho, Fleming! An idler of course. I can see it in your eye. Why is \n\n he on his knees, Father Arnall? \n\n  \n\n --He wrote a bad Latin theme, Father Arnall said, and he missed all \n\n the questions in grammar. \n\n  \n\n --Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies, of course he did! A \n\n born idler! I can see it in the corner of his eye. \n\n  \n\n He banged his pandybat down on the desk and cried: \n\n  \n\n --Up, Fleming! Up, my boy! \n\n  \n\n Fleming stood up slowly. \n\n  \n\n --Hold out! cried the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n Fleming held out his hand. The pandybat came down on it with a loud \n\n smacking sound: one, two, three, four, five, six. \n\n  \n\n --Other hand! \n\n  \n\n The pandybat came down again in six loud quick smacks. \n\n  \n\n --Kneel down! cried the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n Fleming knelt down, squeezing his hands under his armpits, his face \n\n contorted with pain; but Stephen knew how hard his hands were because \n\n Fleming was always rubbing rosin into them. But perhaps he was in great \n\n pain for the noise of the pandybat was terrible. Stephen's heart was \n\n beating and fluttering. \n\n  \n\n --At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no \n\n lazy idle loafers here, lazy idle little schemers. At your work, I tell \n\n you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be \n\n in tomorrow. \n\n  \n\n He poked one of the boys in the side with his pandybat, saying: \n\n  \n\n --You, boy! When will Father Dolan be in again? \n\n  \n\n --Tomorrow, sir, said Tom Furlong's voice. \n\n  \n\n --Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow, said the prefect of studies. \n\n Make up your minds for that. Every day Father Dolan. Write away. You, \n\n boy, who are you? \n\n  \n\n Stephen's heart jumped suddenly. \n\n  \n\n --Dedalus, sir. \n\n  \n\n --Why are you not writing like the others? \n\n  \n\n --Imy \n\n  \n\n He could not speak with fright. \n\n  \n\n --Why is he not writing, Father Arnall? \n\n  \n\n --He broke his glasses, said Father Arnall, and I exempted him from \n\n work. \n\n  \n\n --Broke? What is this I hear? What is this your name is! said the \n\n prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n --Dedalus, sir. \n\n  \n\n --Out here, Dedalus. Lazy little schemer. I see schemer in your face. \n\n Where did you break your glasses? \n\n  \n\n Stephen stumbled into the middle of the class, blinded by fear and haste. \n\n  \n\n --Where did you break your glasses? repeated the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n --The cinder-path, sir. \n\n  \n\n --Hoho! The cinder-path! cried the prefect of studies. I know that trick. \n\n  \n\n Stephen lifted his eyes in wonder and saw for a moment Father Dolan's \n\n white-grey not young face, his baldy white-grey head with fluff at the \n\n sides of it, the steel rims of his spectacles and his no-coloured eyes \n\n looking through the glasses. Why did he say he knew that trick? \n\n  \n\n --Lazy idle little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my \n\n glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this moment! \n\n  \n\n Stephen closed his eyes and held out in the air his trembling hand with \n\n the palm upwards. He felt the prefect of studies touch it for a moment \n\n at the fingers to straighten it and then the swish of the sleeve of the \n\n soutane as the pandybat was lifted to strike. A hot burning stinging \n\n tingling blow like the loud crack of a broken stick made his trembling \n\n hand crumple together like a leaf in the fire: and at the sound and the \n\n pain scalding tears were driven into his eyes. His whole body was shaking \n\n with fright, his arm was shaking and his crumpled burning livid hand shook \n\n like a loose leaf in the air. A cry sprang to his lips, a prayer to be let \n\n off. But though the tears scalded his eyes and his limbs quivered with \n\n pain and fright he held back the hot tears and the cry that scalded his \n\n throat. \n\n  \n\n --Other hand! shouted the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his \n\n left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted \n\n and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain \n\n made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid \n\n quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, \n\n burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in \n\n terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy \n\n of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his \n\n throat and the scalding tears falling out of his eyes and down his \n\n flaming cheeks. \n\n  \n\n --Kneel down, cried the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n Stephen knelt down quickly pressing his beaten hands to his sides. To \n\n think of them beaten and swollen with pain all in a moment made him \n\n feel so sorry for them as if they were not his own but someone else's \n\n that he felt sorry for. And as he knelt, calming the last sobs in his \n\n throat and feeling the burning tingling pain pressed into his sides, he \n\n thought of the hands which he had held out in the air with the palms up \n\n and of the firm touch of the prefect of studies when he had steadied \n\n the shaking fingers and of the beaten swollen reddened mass of palm and \n\n fingers that shook helplessly in the air. \n\n  \n\n --Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies from the \n\n door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any boy, any lazy \n\n idle little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every day. \n\n  \n\n The door closed behind him. \n\n  \n\n The hushed class continued to copy out the themes. Father Arnall rose \n\n from his seat and went among them, helping the boys with gentle words \n\n and telling them the mistakes they had made. His voice was very gentle \n\n and soft. Then he returned to his seat and said to Fleming and Stephen: \n\n  \n\n --You may return to your places, you two. \n\n  \n\n Fleming and Stephen rose and, walking to their seats, sat down. \n\n Stephen, scarlet with shame, opened a book quickly with one weak hand \n\n and bent down upon it, his face close to the page. \n\n  \n\n It was unfair and cruel because the doctor had told him not to read \n\n without glasses and he had written home to his father that morning to \n\n send him a new pair. And Father Arnall had said that he need not study \n\n till the new glasses came. Then to be called a schemer before the class \n\n and to be pandied when he always got the card for first or second and \n\n was the leader of the Yorkists! How could the prefect of studies know \n\n that it was a trick? He felt the touch of the prefect's fingers as they \n\n had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he was going to shake \n\n hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an \n\n instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash. It \n\n was cruel and unfair to make him kneel in the middle of the class then: \n\n and Father Arnall had told them both that they might return to their \n\n places without making any difference between them. He listened to \n\n Father Arnall's low and gentle voice as he corrected the themes. \n\n Perhaps he was sorry now and wanted to be decent. But it was unfair and \n\n cruel. The prefect of studies was a priest but that was cruel and \n\n unfair. And his white-grey face and the no-coloured eyes behind the \n\n steel-rimmed spectacles were cruel looking because he had steadied the \n\n hand first with his firm soft fingers and that was to hit it better and \n\n louder. \n\n  \n\n --It's a stinking mean thing, that's what it is, said Fleming in the \n\n corridor as the classes were passing out in file to the refectory, to \n\n pandy a fellow for what is not his fault. \n\n  \n\n --You really broke your glasses by accident, didn't you? Nasty Roche \n\n asked. \n\n  \n\n Stephen felt his heart filled by Fleming's words and did not answer. \n\n  \n\n --Of course he did! said Fleming. I wouldn't stand it. I'd go up and \n\n tell the rector on him. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, said Cecil Thunder eagerly, and I saw him lift the pandy-bat \n\n over his shoulder and he's not allowed to do that. \n\n  \n\n --Did they hurt you much? Nasty Roche asked. \n\n  \n\n --Very much, Stephen said. \n\n  \n\n --I wouldn't stand it, Fleming repeated, from Baldyhead or any other \n\n Baldyhead. It's a stinking mean low trick, that's what it is. I'd go \n\n straight up to the rector and tell him about it after dinner. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, do. Yes, do, said Cecil Thunder. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, do. Yes, go up and tell the rector on him, Dedalus, said Nasty \n\n Roche, because he said that he'd come in tomorrow again and pandy you. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, yes. Tell the rector, all said. \n\n  \n\n And there were some fellows out of second of grammar listening and one \n\n of them said: \n\n  \n\n --The senate and the Roman people declared that Dedalus had been \n\n wrongly punished. \n\n  \n\n It was wrong; it was unfair and cruel; and, as he sat in the refectory, \n\n he suffered time after time in memory the same humiliation until he \n\n began to wonder whether it might not really be that there was something \n\n in his face which made him look like a schemer and he wished he had a \n\n little mirror to see. But there could not be; and it was unjust and \n\n cruel and unfair. \n\n  \n\n He could not eat the blackish fish fritters they got on Wednesdays in \n\n lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it. Yes, he \n\n would do what the fellows had told him. He would go up and tell the \n\n rector that he had been wrongly punished. A thing like that had been \n\n done before by somebody in history, by some great person whose head was \n\n in the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had been \n\n wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people always \n\n declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished. Those \n\n were the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. \n\n History was all about those men and what they did and that was what \n\n Peter Parley's Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley \n\n himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road over a \n\n heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a \n\n broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking \n\n fast along the road to Greece and Rome. \n\n  \n\n It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was \n\n over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the \n\n corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He \n\n had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the \n\n staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow \n\n corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every \n\n fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of \n\n grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people. \n\n  \n\n What would happen? \n\n  \n\n He heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the \n\n refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting: Paddy \n\n Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth \n\n was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That was \n\n why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for \n\n nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired with the tears, he watched \n\n big Corrigan's broad shoulders and big hanging black head passing in the \n\n file. But he had done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him \n\n hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He had skin \n\n the same colour as the turf-coloured bogwater in the shallow end of the \n\n bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet \n\n tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat. \n\n  \n\n The refectory was half empty and the fellows were still passing out in \n\n file. He could go up the staircase because there was never a priest or \n\n a prefect outside the refectory door. But he could not go. The rector \n\n would side with the prefect of studies and think it was a schoolboy \n\n trick and then the prefect of studies would come in every day the same, \n\n only it would be worse because he would be dreadfully waxy at any \n\n fellow going up to the rector about him. The fellows had told him to go \n\n but they would not go themselves. They had forgotten all about it. No, \n\n it was best to forget all about it and perhaps the prefect of studies \n\n had Only said he would come in. No, it was best to hide out of the way \n\n because when you were small and young you could often escape that way. \n\n  \n\n The fellows at his table stood up. He stood up and passed out among \n\n them in the file. He had to decide. He was coming near the door. If he \n\n went on with the fellows he could never go up to the rector because he \n\n could not leave the playground for that. And if he went and was pandied \n\n all the same all the fellows would make fun and talk about young \n\n Dedalus going up to the rector to tell on the prefect of studies. \n\n  \n\n He was walking down along the matting and he saw the door before him. \n\n It was impossible: he could not. He thought of the baldy head of the \n\n prefect of studies with the cruel no-coloured eyes looking at him and \n\n he heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his \n\n name was. Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first \n\n time? Was he not listening the first time or was it to make fun out of \n\n the name? The great men in the history had names like that and nobody \n\n made fun of them. It was his own name that he should have made fun of \n\n if he wanted to make fun. Dolan: it was like the name of a woman who \n\n washed clothes. \n\n  \n\n He had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the right, walked up \n\n the stairs and, before he could make up his mind to come back, he had \n\n entered the low dark narrow corridor that led to the castle. And as he \n\n crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw, without \n\n turning his head to look, that all the fellows were looking after him \n\n as they went filing by. \n\n  \n\n He passed along the narrow dark corridor, passing little doors that \n\n were the doors of the rooms of the community. He peered in front of him \n\n and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be \n\n portraits. It was dark and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with \n\n tears so that he could not see. But he thought they were the portraits \n\n of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him \n\n silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and \n\n pointing to the words AD MAJOREM DEI GLORIAM in it; saint Francis \n\n Xavier pointing to his chest; Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his \n\n head like one of the prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy \n\n youth--saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzago, and Blessed \n\n John Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they were \n\n young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big \n\n cloak. \n\n  \n\n He came out on the landing above the entrance hall and looked about \n\n him. That was where Hamilton Rowan had passed and the marks of the \n\n soldiers' slugs were there. And it was there that the old servants had \n\n seen the ghost in the white cloak of a marshal. \n\n  \n\n An old servant was sweeping at the end of the landing. He asked him \n\n where was the rector's room and the old servant pointed to the door at \n\n the far end and looked after him as he went on to it and knocked. \n\n  \n\n There was no answer. He knocked again more loudly and his heart jumped \n\n when he heard a muffled voice say: \n\n  \n\n --Come in! \n\n  \n\n He turned the handle and opened the door and fumbled for the handle of \n\n the green baize door inside. He found it and pushed it open and went in. \n\n  \n\n He saw the rector sitting at a desk writing. There was a skull on the \n\n desk and a strange solemn smell in the room like the old leather of \n\n chairs. \n\n  \n\n His heart was beating fast on account of the solemn place he was in and \n\n the silence of the room: and he looked at the skull and at the rector's \n\n kind-looking face. \n\n  \n\n --Well, my little man, said the rector, what is it? \n\n  \n\n Stephen swallowed down the thing in his throat and said: \n\n  \n\n --I broke my glasses, sir. \n\n  \n\n The rector opened his mouth and said: \n\n  \n\n --O! \n\n  \n\n Then he smiled and said: \n\n  \n\n --Well, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair. \n\n  \n\n --I wrote home, sir, said Stephen, and Father Arnall said I am not to \n\n study till they come. \n\n  \n\n --Quite right! said the rector. \n\n  \n\n Stephen swallowed down the thing again and tried to keep his legs and \n\n his voice from shaking. \n\n  \n\n --But, sir-- \n\n  \n\n --Yes? \n\n  \n\n --Father Dolan came in today and pandied me because I was not writing \n\n my theme. \n\n  \n\n The rector looked at him in silence and he could feel the blood rising \n\n to his face and the tears about to rise to his eyes. \n\n  \n\n The rector said: \n\n  \n\n --Your name is Dedalus, isn't it? \n\n  \n\n --Yes, sir \n\n  \n\n --And where did you break your glasses? \n\n  \n\n --On the cinder-path, sir. A fellow was coming out of the bicycle \n\n house and I fell and they got broken. I don't know the fellow's name. \n\n  \n\n The rector looked at him again in silence. Then he smiled and said: \n\n  \n\n --O, well, it was a mistake; I am sure Father Dolan did not know. \n\n  \n\n --But I told him I broke them, sir, and he pandied me. \n\n  \n\n --Did you tell him that you had written home for a new pair? the \n\n rector asked. \n\n  \n\n --No, sir. \n\n  \n\n --O well then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand. You can \n\n say that I excuse you from your lessons for a few days. \n\n  \n\n Stephen said quickly for fear his trembling would prevent him: \n\n  \n\n --Yes, sir, but Father Dolan said he will come in tomorrow to pandy me \n\n again for it. \n\n  \n\n --Very well, the rector said, it is a mistake and I shall speak to \n\n Father Dolan myself. Will that do now? \n\n  \n\n Stephen felt the tears wetting his eyes and murmured: \n\n  \n\n --O yes sir, thanks. \n\n  \n\n The rector held his hand across the side of the desk where the skull \n\n was and Stephen, placing his hand in it for a moment, felt a cool moist \n\n palm. \n\n  \n\n --Good day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and bowing. \n\n  \n\n --Good day, sir, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n He bowed and walked quietly out of the room, closing the doors \n\n carefully and slowly. \n\n  \n\n But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in \n\n the low narrow dark corridor he began to walk faster and faster. Faster \n\n and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly. He bumped his \n\n elbow against the door at the end and, hurrying down the staircase, \n\n walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air. \n\n  \n\n He could hear the cries of the fellows on the playgrounds. He broke \n\n into a run and, running quicker and quicker, ran across the cinderpath \n\n and reached the third line playground, panting. \n\n  \n\n The fellows had seen him running. They closed round him in a ring, \n\n pushing one against another to hear. \n\n  \n\n --Tell us! Tell us! \n\n  \n\n --What did he say? \n\n  \n\n --Did you go in? \n\n  \n\n --What did he say? \n\n  \n\n --Tell us! Tell us! \n\n  \n\n He told them what he had said and what the rector had said and, when he \n\n had told them, all the fellows flung their caps spinning up into the \n\n air and cried: \n\n  \n\n --Hurroo! \n\n  \n\n They caught their caps and sent them up again spinning sky-high and \n\n cried again: \n\n  \n\n --Hurroo! Hurroo! \n\n  \n\n They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them \n\n and carried him along till he struggled to get free. And when he had \n\n escaped from them they broke away in all directions, flinging their \n\n caps again into the air and whistling as they went spinning up and \n\n crying: \n\n  \n\n --Hurroo! \n\n  \n\n And they gave three groans for Baldyhead Dolan and three cheers for \n\n Conmee and they said he was the decentest rector that was ever in \n\n Clongowes. \n\n  \n\n The cheers died away in the soft grey air. He was alone. He was happy \n\n and free; but he would not be anyway proud with Father Dolan. He would \n\n be very quiet and obedient: and he wished that he could do something \n\n kind for him to show him that he was not proud. \n\n  \n\n The air was soft and grey and mild and evening was coming.",

Stephen was \n\n glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very \n\n liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels \n\n outside the counter. He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or \n\n three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his \n\n grandnephew's hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on Stephen's \n\n feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say: \n\n  \n\n --Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're good for your bowels. \n\n  \n\n When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park \n\n where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike Flynn, would be found \n\n seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen's run \n\n round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway \n\n station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style \n\n Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees well lifted and \n\n his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice \n\n was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate \n\n them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of \n\n blue canvas shoes. A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids \n\n would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had \n\n sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had \n\n heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners \n\n of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his \n\n trainer's flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained \n\n fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the \n\n mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task \n\n and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers \n\n ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into \n\n the pouch. \n\n  \n\n On the way home uncle Charles would often pay a visit to the chapel \n\n and, as the font was above Stephen's reach, the old man would dip his \n\n hand and then sprinkle the water briskly about Stephen's clothes and on \n\n the floor of the porch. While he prayed he knelt on his red \n\n handkerchief and read above his breath from a thumb blackened prayer \n\n book wherein catchwords were printed at the foot of every page. Stephen \n\n knelt at his side respecting, though he did not share, his piety. He \n\n often wondered what his grand-uncle prayed for so seriously. Perhaps he \n\n prayed for the souls in purgatory or for the grace of a happy death or \n\n perhaps he prayed that God might send him back a part of the big \n\n fortune he had squandered in Cork. \n\n  \n\n On Sundays Stephen with his father and his grand-uncle took their \n\n constitutional. The old man was a nimble walker in spite of his corns \n\n and often ten or twelve miles of the road were covered. The little \n\n village of Stillorgan was the parting of the ways. Either they went to \n\n the left towards the Dublin mountains or along the Goatstown road and \n\n thence into Dundrum, coming home by Sandyford. Trudging along the road \n\n or standing in some grimy wayside public house his elders spoke \n\n constantly of the subjects nearer their hearts, of Irish politics, of \n\n Munster and of the legends of their own family, to all of which Stephen \n\n lent an avid ear. Words which he did not understand he said over and \n\n over to himself till he had learnt them by heart: and through them he \n\n had glimpses of the real world about them. The hour when he too would \n\n take part in the life of that world seemed drawing near and in secret \n\n he began to make ready for the great part which he felt awaited him the \n\n nature of which he only dimly apprehended. \n\n  \n\n His evenings were his own; and he pored over a ragged translation of \n\n THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO. The figure of that dark avenger stood forth \n\n in his mind for whatever he had heard or divined in childhood of the \n\n strange and terrible. At night he built up on the parlour table an \n\n image of the wonderful island cave out of transfers and paper flowers \n\n and coloured tissue paper and strips of the silver and golden paper in \n\n which chocolate is wrapped. When he had broken up this scenery, weary \n\n of its tinsel, there would come to his mind the bright picture of \n\n Marseille, of sunny trellises, and of Mercedes. \n\n  \n\n Outside Blackrock, on the road that led to the mountains, stood a small \n\n whitewashed house in the garden of which grew many rosebushes: and in \n\n this house, he told himself, another Mercedes lived. Both on the \n\n outward and on the homeward journey he measured distance by this \n\n landmark: and in his imagination he lived through a long train of \n\n adventures, marvellous as those in the book itself, towards the close \n\n of which there appeared an image of himself, grown older and sadder, \n\n standing in a moonlit garden with Mercedes who had so many years before \n\n slighted his love, and with a sadly proud gesture of refusal, saying: \n\n  \n\n --Madam, I never eat muscatel grapes. \n\n  \n\n He became the ally of a boy named Aubrey Mills and founded with him a \n\n gang of adventurers in the avenue. Aubrey carried a whistle dangling \n\n from his buttonhole and a bicycle lamp attached to his belt while the \n\n others had short sticks thrust daggerwise through theirs. Stephen, who \n\n had read of Napoleon's plain style of dress, chose to remain unadorned \n\n and thereby heightened for himself the pleasure of taking counsel with \n\n his lieutenant before giving orders. The gang made forays into the \n\n gardens of old maids or went down to the castle and fought a battle on \n\n the shaggy weed-grown rocks, coming home after it weary stragglers with \n\n the stale odours of the foreshore in their nostrils and the rank oils \n\n of the seawrack upon their hands and in their hair. \n\n  \n\n Aubrey and Stephen had a common milkman and often they drove out in the \n\n milk-car to Carrickmines where the cows were at grass. While the men \n\n were milking the boys would take turns in riding the tractable mare \n\n round the field. But when autumn came the cows were driven home from \n\n the grass: and the first sight of the filthy cowyard at Stradbrook with \n\n its foul green puddles and clots of liquid dung and steaming bran \n\n troughs, sickened Stephen's heart. The cattle which had seemed so \n\n beautiful in the country on sunny days revolted him and he could not \n\n even look at the milk they yielded. \n\n  \n\n The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to \n\n be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when \n\n Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an \n\n hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were \n\n no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went \n\n round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly \n\n drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no \n\n repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. \n\n Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of \n\n a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the \n\n servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought \n\n it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every \n\n evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of \n\n gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which \n\n had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round \n\n the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at \n\n his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long \n\n stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he \n\n understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason \n\n why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he \n\n had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he \n\n had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish \n\n conception of the world.

      "text": "outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering \n\n along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and \n\n rattling behind him. \n\n  \n\n He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange \n\n unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and \n\n led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace \n\n of the gardens and the kindly lights in the windows poured a tender \n\n influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play \n\n annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than \n\n he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not \n\n want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial \n\n image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to \n\n seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this \n\n image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would \n\n meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst, \n\n perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be \n\n alone, surrounded by darkness and silence: and in that moment of \n\n supreme tenderness he would be transfigured. \n\n  \n\n He would fade into something impalpable under her eyes and then in a \n\n moment he would be transfigured. Weakness and timidity and inexperience \n\n would fall from him in that magic moment. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n * * * * * \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Two great yellow caravans had halted one morning before the door and \n\n men had come tramping into the house to dismantle it. The furniture had \n\n been hustled out through the front garden which was strewn with wisps \n\n of straw and rope ends and into the huge vans at the gate. When all had \n\n been safely stowed the vans had set off noisily down the avenue: and \n\n from the window of the railway carriage, in which he had sat with his \n\n red-eyed mother, Stephen had seen them lumbering along the Merrion \n\n Road. \n\n  \n\n The parlour fire would not draw that evening and Mr Dedalus rested the \n\n poker against the bars of the grate to attract the flame. Uncle Charles \n\n dozed in a corner of the half furnished uncarpeted room and near him \n\n the family portraits leaned against the wall. The lamp on the table \n\n shed a weak light over the boarded floor, muddied by the feet of the \n\n van-men. Stephen sat on a footstool beside his father listening to a \n\n long and incoherent monologue. He understood little or nothing of it at \n\n first but he became slowly aware that his father had enemies and that \n\n some fight was going to take place. He felt, too, that he was being \n\n enlisted for the fight, that some duty was being laid upon his \n\n shoulders. The sudden flight from the comfort and revery of Blackrock, \n\n the passage through the gloomy foggy city, the thought of the bare \n\n cheerless house in which they were now to live made his heart heavy, \n\n and again an intuition, a foreknowledge of the future came to him. He \n\n understood also why the servants had often whispered together in the \n\n hall and why his father had often stood on the hearthrug with his back \n\n to the fire, talking loudly to uncle Charles who urged him to sit down \n\n and eat his dinner. \n\n  \n\n --There's a crack of the whip left in me yet, Stephen, old chap, said \n\n Mr Dedalus, poking at the dull fire with fierce energy.

      "text": "The swift December dusk had come tumbling clownishly after its dull day \n\n and, as he stared through the dull square of the window of the \n\n schoolroom, he felt his belly crave for its food. He hoped there would \n\n be stew for dinner, turnips and carrots and bruised potatoes and fat \n\n mutton pieces to be ladled out in thick peppered flour-fattened sauce. \n\n Stuff it into you, his belly counselled him. \n\n  \n\n It would be a gloomy secret night. After early nightfall the yellow \n\n lamps would light up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the \n\n brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, \n\n circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until \n\n his feet led him suddenly round a dark corner. The whores would be just \n\n coming out of their houses making ready for the night, yawning lazily \n\n after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. \n\n He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own \n\n will or a sudden call to his sin-loving soul from their soft perfumed \n\n flesh. Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified \n\n only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them; \n\n his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph \n\n of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, \n\n the drawling jargon of greeting: \n\n  \n\n --Hello, Bertie, any good in your mind? \n\n  \n\n --Is that you, pigeon? \n\n  \n\n --Number ten. Fresh Nelly is waiting on you. \n\n  \n\n --Good night, husband! Coming in to have a short time? \n\n  \n\n The equation on the page of his scribbler began to spread out a \n\n widening tail, eyed and starred like a peacock's; and, when the eyes \n\n and stars of its indices had been eliminated, began slowly to fold \n\n itself together again. The indices appearing and disappearing were eyes \n\n opening and closing; the eyes opening and closing were stars being born \n\n and being quenched. The vast cycle of starry life bore his weary mind \n\n outward to its verge and inward to its centre, a distant music \n\n accompanying him outward and inward. What music? The music came nearer \n\n and he recalled the words, the words of Shelley's fragment upon the \n\n moon wandering companionless, pale for weariness. The stars began to \n\n crumble and a cloud of fine stardust fell through space. \n\n  \n\n The dull light fell more faintly upon the page whereon another equation \n\n began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. \n\n It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by \n\n sin, spreading abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding \n\n back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own lights and fires. \n\n They were quenched: and the cold darkness filled chaos. \n\n  \n\n A cold lucid indifference reigned in his soul. At his first violent sin \n\n he had felt a wave of vitality pass out of him and had feared to find \n\n his body or his soul maimed by the excess. Instead the vital wave had \n\n carried him on its bosom out of himself and back again when it receded: \n\n and no part of body or soul had been maimed but a dark peace had been \n\n established between them. The chaos in which his ardour extinguished \n\n itself was a cold indifferent knowledge of himself. He had sinned \n\n mortally not once but many times and he knew that, while he stood in \n\n danger of eternal damnation for the first sin alone, by every \n\n succeeding sin he multiplied his guilt and his punishment. His days and \n\n works and thoughts could make no atonement for him, the fountains of \n\n sanctifying grace having ceased to refresh his soul. At most, by an \n\n alms given to a beggar whose blessing he fled from, he might hope \n\n wearily to win for himself some measure of actual grace. Devotion had \n\n gone by the board. What did it avail to pray when he knew that his soul \n\n lusted after its own destruction? A certain pride, a certain awe, \n\n withheld him from offering to God even one prayer at night, though he \n\n knew it was in God's power to take away his life while he slept and \n\n hurl his soul hellward ere he could beg for mercy. His pride in his own \n\n sin, his loveless awe of God, told him that his offence was too \n\n grievous to be atoned for in whole or in part by a false homage to the \n\n All-seeing and All-knowing. \n\n  \n\n --Well now, Ennis, I declare you have a head and so has my stick! Do \n\n you mean to say that you are not able to tell me what a surd is? \n\n  \n\n The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his \n\n fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On Sunday \n\n mornings as he passed the church door he glanced coldly at the \n\n worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, outside the church, \n\n morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear. \n\n Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair-oil with which \n\n they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed \n\n at. He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their \n\n innocence which he could cajole so easily. \n\n  \n\n On the wall of his bedroom hung an illuminated scroll, the certificate \n\n of his prefecture in the college of the sodality of the Blessed Virgin \n\n Mary. On Saturday mornings when the sodality met in the chapel to \n\n recite the little office his place was a cushioned kneeling-desk at the \n\n right of the altar from which he led his wing of boys through the \n\n responses. The falsehood of his position did not pain him. If at \n\n moments he felt an impulse to rise from his post of honour and, \n\n confessing before them all his unworthiness, to leave the chapel, a \n\n glance at their faces restrained him. The imagery of the psalms of \n\n prophecy soothed his barren pride. The glories of Mary held his soul \n\n captive: spikenard and myrrh and frankincense, symbolizing her royal \n\n lineage, her emblems, the late-flowering plant and late-blossoming \n\n tree, symbolizing the age-long gradual growth of her cultus among men. \n\n When it fell to him to read the lesson towards the close of the office \n\n he read it in a veiled voice, lulling his conscience to its music. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n QUASI CEDRUS EXALTATA SUM IN LIBANON ET QUASI CUPRESSUS IN MONTE SION. \n\n QUASI PALMA EXALTATA SUM IN GADES ET QUASI PLANTATIO ROSAE IN JERICHO. \n\n QUASI ULIVA SPECIOSA IN CAMPIS ET QUASI PLATANUS EXALTATA SUM JUXTA \n\n AQUAM IN PLATEIS. SICUT CINNAMOMUM ET BALSAMUM AROMATIZANS ODOREM DEDI \n\n ET QUASI MYRRHA ELECTA DEDI SUAVITATEM ODORIS. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n His sin, which had covered him from the sight of God, had led him \n\n nearer to the refuge of sinners. Her eyes seemed to regard him with \n\n mild pity; her holiness, a strange light glowing faintly upon her frail \n\n flesh, did not humiliate the sinner who approached her. If ever he was \n\n impelled to cast sin from him and to repent the impulse that moved him \n\n was the wish to be her knight. If ever his soul, re-entering her \n\n dwelling shyly after the frenzy of his body's lust had spent itself, \n\n was turned towards her whose emblem is the morning star, BRIGHT AND \n\n MUSICAL, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING PEACE, it was when her names \n\n were murmured softly by lips whereon there still lingered foul and \n\n shameful words, the savour itself of a lewd kiss. \n\n  \n\n That was strange. He tried to think how it could be. But the dusk, \n\n deepening in the schoolroom, covered over his thoughts. The bell rang. \n\n The master marked the sums and cuts to be done for the next lesson and \n\n went out. Heron, beside Stephen, began to hum tunelessly. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n MY EXCELLENT FRIEND BOMBADOS. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n Ennis, who had gone to the yard, came back, saying: \n\n  \n\n --The boy from the house is coming up for the rector. \n\n  \n\n A tall boy behind Stephen rubbed his hands and said: \n\n  \n\n --That's game ball. We can scut the whole hour. He won't be in till \n\n after half two. Then you can ask him questions on the catechism, \n\n Dedalus. \n\n  \n\n Stephen, leaning back and drawing idly on his scribbler, listened to \n\n the talk about him which Heron checked from time to time by saying: \n\n  \n\n --Shut up, will you. Don't make such a bally racket! \n\n  \n\n It was strange too that he found an arid pleasure in following up to \n\n the end the rigid lines of the doctrines of the church and penetrating \n\n into obscure silences only to hear and feel the more deeply his own \n\n condemnation. The sentence of saint James which says that he who \n\n offends against one commandment becomes guilty of all, had seemed to him \n\n first a swollen phrase until he had begun to grope in the darkness \n\n of his own state. From the evil seed of lust all other deadly \n\n sins had sprung forth: pride in himself and contempt of others, \n\n covetousness In using money for the purchase of unlawful pleasures, \n\n envy of those whose vices he could not reach to and calumnious \n\n murmuring against the pious, gluttonous enjoyment of food, \n\n the dull glowering anger amid which he brooded upon his longing, the \n\n swamp of spiritual and bodily sloth in which his whole being had sunk. \n\n  \n\n As he sat in his bench gazing calmly at the rector's shrewd harsh face, \n\n his mind wound itself in and out of the curious questions proposed to \n\n it. If a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to \n\n amass a huge fortune how much was he obliged to give back, the pound he \n\n had stolen only or the pound together with the compound interest \n\n accruing upon it or all his huge fortune? If a layman in giving baptism \n\n pour the water before saying the words is the child baptized? Is \n\n baptism with a mineral water valid? How comes it that while the first \n\n beatitude promises the kingdom of heaven to the poor of heart the \n\n second beatitude promises also to the meek that they shall possess the \n\n land? Why was the sacrament of the eucharist instituted under the two \n\n species of bread and wine if Jesus `Christ be present body and blood, \n\n soul and divinity, in the bread alone and in the wine alone? Does a \n\n tiny particle of the consecrated bread contain all the body and blood \n\n of Jesus Christ or a part only of the body and blood? If the wine \n\n change into vinegar and the host crumble into corruption after they \n\n have been consecrated, is Jesus Christ still present under their \n\n species as God and as man? \n\n  \n\n --Here he is! Here he is! \n\n  \n\n A boy from his post at the window had seen the rector come from the \n\n house. All the catechisms were opened and all heads bent upon them \n\n silently. The rector entered and took his seat on the dais. A gentle \n\n kick from the tall boy in the bench behind urged Stephen to ask a \n\n difficult question. \n\n  \n\n The rector did not ask for a catechism to hear the lesson from. He \n\n clasped his hands on the desk and said: \n\n  \n\n --The retreat will begin on Wednesday afternoon in honour of saint \n\n Francis Xavier whose feast day is Saturday. The retreat will go on from \n\n Wednesday to Friday. On Friday confession will be heard all the \n\n afternoon after beads. If any boys have special confessors perhaps it \n\n will be better for them not to change. Mass will be on Saturday morning \n\n at nine o'clock and general communion for the whole college. Saturday \n\n will be a free day. But Saturday and Sunday being free days some boys \n\n might be inclined to think that Monday is a free day also. Beware of \n\n making that mistake. I think you, Lawless, are likely to make that \n\n mistake. \n\n  \n\n --I sir? Why, sir? \n\n  \n\n A little wave of quiet mirth broke forth over the class of boys from \n\n the rector's grim smile. Stephen's heart began slowly to fold and fade \n\n with fear like a withering flower. \n\n  \n\n The rector went on gravely: \n\n  \n\n --You are all familiar with the story of the life of saint Francis \n\n Xavier, I suppose, the patron of your college. He came of an old and \n\n illustrious Spanish family and you remember that he was one of the \n\n first followers of saint Ignatius. They met in Paris where Francis \n\n Xavier was professor of philosophy at the university. This young and \n\n brilliant nobleman and man of letters entered heart and soul into the \n\n ideas of our glorious founder and you know that he, at his own desire, \n\n was sent by saint Ignatius to preach to the Indians. He is called, as \n\n you know, the apostle of the Indies. He went from country to country in \n\n the east, from Africa to India, from India to Japan, baptizing the \n\n people. He is said to have baptized as many as ten thousand idolaters \n\n in one month. It is said that his right arm had grown powerless from \n\n having been raised so often over the heads of those whom he baptized. \n\n He wished then to go to China to win still more souls for God but he \n\n died of fever on the island of Sancian. A great saint, saint Francis \n\n Xavier! A great soldier of God! \n\n  \n\n The rector paused and then, shaking his clasped hands before him, went \n\n on: \n\n  \n\n --He had the faith in him that moves mountains. Ten thousand souls won \n\n for God in a single month! That is a true conqueror, true to the motto \n\n of our order: AD MAJOREM DEI GLORIAM! A saint who has great power in \n\n heaven, remember: power to intercede for us in our grief; power to \n\n obtain whatever we pray for if it be for the good of our souls; power \n\n above all to obtain for us the grace to repent if we be in sin. A great \n\n saint, saint Francis Xavier! A great fisher of souls! \n\n  \n\n He ceased to shake his clasped hands and, resting them against his \n\n forehead, looked right and left of them keenly at his listeners out of \n\n his dark stern eyes. \n\n  \n\n In the silence their dark fire kindled the dusk into a tawny glow. \n\n Stephen's heart had withered up like a flower of the desert that feels \n\n the simoom coming from afar. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n * * * * * \n\n  \n\n  \n\n --REMEMBER ONLY THY LAST THINGS AND THOU SHALT NOT SIN FOR EVER-- \n\n words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ, from the book of \n\n Ecclesiastes, seventh chapter, fortieth verse. In the name of the \n\n Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \n\n  \n\n Stephen sat in the front bench of the chapel. Father Arnall sat at a \n\n table to the left of the altar. He wore about his shoulders a heavy \n\n cloak; his pale face was drawn and his voice broken with rheum. The \n\n figure of his old master, so strangely rearisen, brought back to \n\n Stephen's mind his life at Clongowes: the wide playgrounds, swarming \n\n with boys; the square ditch; the little cemetery off the main avenue of \n\n limes where he had dreamed of being buried; the firelight on the wall \n\n of the infirmary where he lay sick; the sorrowful face of Brother \n\n Michael. His soul, as these memories came back to him, became again a \n\n child's soul. \n\n  \n\n --We are assembled here today, my dear little brothers in Christ, for \n\n one brief moment far away from the busy bustle of the outer world to \n\n celebrate and to honour one of the greatest of saints, the apostle of \n\n the Indies, the patron saint also of your college, saint Francis \n\n Xavier. Year after year, for much longer than any of you, my dear \n\n little boys, can remember or than I can remember, the boys of this \n\n college have met in this very chapel to make their annual retreat \n\n before the feast day of their patron saint. Time has gone on and \n\n brought with it its changes. Even in the last few years what changes \n\n can most of you not remember? Many of the boys who sat in those front \n\n benches a few years ago are perhaps now in distant lands, in the \n\n burning tropics, or immersed in professional duties or in seminaries, \n\n or voyaging over the vast expanse of the deep or, it may be, already \n\n called by the great God to another life and to the rendering up of \n\n their stewardship. And still as the years roll by, bringing with them \n\n changes for good and bad, the memory of the great saint is honoured by \n\n the boys of this college who make every year their annual retreat on \n\n the days preceding the feast day set apart by our Holy Mother the \n\n Church to transmit to all the ages the name and fame of one of the \n\n greatest sons of catholic Spain. \n\n  \n\n --Now what is the meaning of this word RETREAT and why is it allowed \n\n on all hands to be a most salutary practice for all who desire to lead \n\n before God and in the eyes of men a truly christian life? A retreat, my \n\n dear boys, signifies a withdrawal for awhile from the cares of our \n\n life, the cares of this workaday world, in order to examine the state \n\n of our conscience, to reflect on the mysteries of holy religion and to \n\n understand better why we are here in this world. During these few days \n\n I intend to put before you some thoughts concerning the four last \n\n things. They are, as you know from your catechism, death, judgement, \n\n hell, and heaven. We shall try to understand them fully during these \n\n few days so that we may derive from the understanding of them a lasting \n\n benefit to our souls. And remember, my dear boys, that we have been \n\n sent into this world for one thing and for one thing alone: to do God's \n\n holy will and to save our immortal souls. All else is worthless. One \n\n thing alone is needful, the salvation of one's soul. What doth it \n\n profit a man to gain the whole world if he suffer the loss of his \n\n immortal soul? Ah, my dear boys, believe me there is nothing in this \n\n wretched world that can make up for such a loss. \n\n  \n\n --I will ask you, therefore, my dear boys, to put away from your minds \n\n during these few days all worldly thoughts, whether of study or \n\n pleasure or ambition, and to give all your attention to the state of \n\n your souls. I need hardly remind you that during the days of the \n\n retreat all boys are expected to preserve a quiet and pious demeanour \n\n and to shun all loud unseemly pleasure. The elder boys, of course, will \n\n see that this custom is not infringed and I look especially to the \n\n prefects and officers of the sodality of Our Blessed Lady and of the \n\n sodality of the holy angels to set a good example to their \n\n fellow-students. \n\n  \n\n --Let us try, therefore, to make this retreat in honour of saint \n\n Francis with our whole heart and our whole mind. God's blessing will \n\n then be upon all your year's studies. But, above and beyond all, let \n\n this retreat be one to which you can look back in after years when \n\n maybe you are far from this college and among very different \n\n surroundings, to which you can look back with joy and thankfulness and \n\n give thanks to God for having granted you this occasion of laying the \n\n first foundation of a pious honourable zealous christian life. And if, \n\n as may so happen, there be at this moment in these benches any poor \n\n soul who has had the unutterable misfortune to lose God's holy grace \n\n and to fall into grievous sin, I fervently trust and pray that this \n\n retreat may be the turning point in the life of that soul. I pray to \n\n God through the merits of His zealous servant Francis Xavier, that such \n\n a soul may be led to sincere repentance and that the holy communion on \n\n saint Francis's day of this year may be a lasting covenant between God \n\n and that soul. For just and unjust, for saint and sinner alike, may \n\n this retreat be a memorable one. \n\n  \n\n --Help me, my dear little brothers in Christ. Help me by your pious \n\n attention, by your own devotion, by your outward demeanour. Banish from \n\n your minds all worldly thoughts and think only of the last things, \n\n death, judgement, hell, and heaven. He who remembers these things, says \n\n Ecclesiastes, shall not sin for ever. He who remembers the last things \n\n will act and think with them always before his eyes. He will live a \n\n good life and die a good death, believing and knowing that, if he has \n\n sacrificed much in this earthly life, it will be given to him a \n\n hundredfold and a thousandfold more in the life to come, in the kingdom \n\n without end--a blessing, my dear boys, which I wish you from my heart, \n\n one and all, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy \n\n Ghost. Amen! \n\n  \n\n As he walked home with silent companions, a thick fog seemed to compass \n\n his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and reveal \n\n what it had hidden. He ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the \n\n meal was over and the grease-strewn plates lay abandoned on the table, \n\n he rose and went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth \n\n with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to the \n\n state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the end; and \n\n a faint glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind. He pressed \n\n his face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the \n\n darkening street. Forms passed this way and that through the dull \n\n light. And that was life. The letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily \n\n upon his mind, pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slow \n\n boorish insistence. His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross \n\n grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening \n\n dusk while the body that was his stood, listless and dishonoured, \n\n gazing out of darkened eyes, helpless, perturbed, and human for a \n\n bovine god to stare upon. \n\n  \n\n The next day brought death and judgement, stirring his soul slowly from \n\n its listless despair. The faint glimmer of fear became a terror of \n\n spirit as the hoarse voice of the preacher blew death into his soul. He \n\n suffered its agony. He felt the death chill touch the extremities and \n\n creep onward towards the heart, the film of death veiling the eyes, the \n",

      "text": "Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and secret, the \n\n whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's knife had probed deeply \n\n into his disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul was \n\n festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was right. God's turn had come. \n\n Like a beast in its lair his soul had lain down in its own filth but \n\n the blasts of the angel's trumpet had driven him forth from the \n\n darkness of sin into the light. The words of doom cried by the angel \n\n shattered in an instant his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last \n\n day blew through his mind, his sins, the jewel-eyed harlots of his \n\n imagination, fled before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their \n\n terror and huddled under a mane of hair. \n\n  \n\n As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the light laughter of a \n\n girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound smote his heart more \n\n strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he \n\n turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled \n\n shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. \n\n The image of Emma appeared before him, and under her eyes the flood of \n\n shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind \n\n had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon \n\n her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that \n\n poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils. \n\n The soot-coated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of \n\n the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful \n\n wantonness he lay for hours sinning In thought and deed; his monstrous \n\n dreams, peopled by ape-like creatures and by harlots with gleaming \n\n jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty \n\n confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them \n\n under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or \n\n beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl \n\n might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! \n\n Was it possible he had done these things? A cold sweat broke out upon \n\n his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain. \n\n  \n\n When the agony of shame had passed from him he tried to raise his soul \n\n from its abject powerlessness. God and the Blessed Virgin were too far \n\n from him: God was too great and stern and the Blessed Virgin too pure \n\n and holy. But he imagined that he stood near Emma in a wide land and, \n\n humbly and in tears, bent and kissed the elbow of her sleeve. \n\n  \n\n In the wide land under a tender lucid evening sky, a cloud drifting \n\n westward amid a pale green sea of heaven, they stood together, children \n\n that had erred. Their error had offended deeply God's majesty though it \n\n was the error of two children; but it had not offended her whose beauty \n\n IS NOT LIKE EARTHLY BEAUTY, DANGEROUS TO LOOK UPON, BUT LIKE THE \n\n MORNING STAR WHICH. IS ITS EMBLEM, BRIGHT AND MUSICAL. The eyes were \n\n not offended which she turned upon him nor reproachful. She placed \n\n their hands together, hand in hand, and said, speaking to their hearts: \n\n  \n\n --Take hands, Stephen and Emma. It is a beautiful evening now in \n\n heaven. You have erred but you are always my children. It is one heart \n\n that loves another heart. Take hands together, my dear children, and \n\n you will be happy together and your hearts will love each other. \n\n  \n\n The chapel was flooded by the dull scarlet light that filtered through \n\n the lowered blinds; and through the fissure between the last blind and \n\n the sash a shaft of wan light entered like a spear and touched the \n\n embossed brasses of the candlesticks upon the altar that gleamed like \n\n the battle-worn mail armour of angels. \n\n  \n\n Rain was falling on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. It would \n\n rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch by inch, covering \n\n the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and houses, covering the \n\n monuments and the mountain tops. All life would be choked off, \n\n noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, pigs, children: noiselessly \n\n floating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the world. Forty \n\n days and forty nights the rain would fall till the waters covered the \n\n face of the earth. \n\n  \n\n It might be. Why not? \n\n  \n\n --HELL HAS ENLARGED ITS SOUL AND OPENED ITS MOUTH WITHOUT ANY LIMITS-- \n\n words taken, my dear little brothers in Christ Jesus, from the book of \n\n Isaias, fifth chapter, fourteenth verse. In the name of the Father and \n\n of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. \n\n  \n\n The preacher took a chainless watch from a pocket within his soutane \n\n and, having considered its dial for a moment in silence, placed it \n\n silently before him on the table. \n\n  \n\n He began to speak in a quiet tone. \n\n  \n\n --Adam and Eve, my dear boys, were, as you know, our first parents, \n\n and you will remember that they were created by God in order that the \n\n seats in heaven left vacant by the fall of Lucifer and his rebellious \n\n angels might be filled again. Lucifer, we are told, was a son of the \n\n morning, a radiant and mighty angel; yet he fell: he fell and there \n\n fell with him a third part of the host of heaven: he fell and was \n\n hurled with his rebellious angels into hell. What his sin was we cannot \n\n say. Theologians consider that it was the sin of pride, the sinful \n\n thought conceived in an instant: NON SERVIAM: I WILL NOT SERVE. That \n\n instant was his ruin. \n\n  \n\n He offended the majesty of God by the sinful thought of one instant and \n\n God cast him out of heaven into hell for ever. \n\n  \n\n --Adam and Eve were then created by God and placed in Eden, in the \n\n plain of Damascus, that lovely garden resplendent with sunlight and \n\n colour, teeming with luxuriant vegetation. The fruitful earth gave them \n\n her bounty: beasts and birds were their willing servants: they knew not \n\n the ills our flesh is heir to, disease and poverty and death: all that \n\n a great and generous God could do for them was done. But there was one \n\n condition imposed on them by God: obedience to His word. They were not \n\n to eat of the fruit of the forbidden tree. \n\n  \n\n --Alas, my dear little boys, they too fell. The devil, once a shining \n\n angel, a son of the morning, now a foul fiend came in the shape of a \n\n serpent, the subtlest of all the beasts of the field. He envied them. \n\n He, the fallen great one, could not bear to think that man, a being of \n\n clay, should possess the inheritance which he by his sin had forfeited \n\n for ever. He came to the woman, the weaker vessel, and poured the \n\n poison of his eloquence into her ear, promising her--O, the blasphemy \n\n of that promise!--that if she and Adam ate of the forbidden fruit they \n\n would become as gods, nay as God Himself. Eve yielded to the wiles of \n\n the archtempter. She ate the apple and gave it also to Adam who had not \n\n the moral courage to resist her. The poison tongue of Satan had done \n\n its work. They fell. \n\n  \n\n --And then the voice of God was heard in that garden, calling His \n\n creature man to account: and Michael, prince of the heavenly host, with \n\n a sword of flame in his hand, appeared before the guilty pair and drove \n\n them forth from Eden into the world, the world of sickness and \n\n striving, of cruelty and disappointment, of labour and hardship, to \n\n earn their bread in the sweat of their brow. But even then how merciful \n\n was God! He took pity on our poor degraded parents and promised that in \n\n the fullness of time He would send down from heaven One who would \n\n redeem them, make them once more children of God and heirs to the \n\n kingdom of heaven: and that One, that Redeemer of fallen man, was to be \n\n God's only begotten Son, the Second Person of the Most Blessed Trinity, \n\n the Eternal Word. \n\n  \n\n --He came. He was born of a virgin pure, Mary the virgin mother. He \n\n was born in a poor cowhouse in Judea and lived as a humble carpenter \n\n for thirty years until the hour of His mission had come. And then, \n\n filled with love for men, He went forth and called to men to hear the \n\n new gospel. \n\n  \n\n --Did they listen? Yes, they listened but would not hear. He was \n\n seized and bound like a common criminal, mocked at as a fool, set aside \n\n to give place to a public robber, scourged with five thousand lashes, \n\n crowned with a crown of thorns, hustled through the streets by the \n\n jewish rabble and the Roman soldiery, stripped of his garments and \n\n hanged upon a gibbet and His side was pierced with a lance and from the \n\n wounded body of our Lord water and blood issued continually. \n\n  \n\n --Yet even then, in that hour of supreme agony, Our Merciful Redeemer had \n\n pity for mankind. Yet even there, on the hill of Calvary, He founded \n\n the holy catholic church against which, it is promised, the gates of \n\n hell shall not prevail. He founded it upon the rock of ages, and \n\n endowed it with His grace, with sacraments and sacrifice, and promised \n\n that if men would obey the word of His church they would still enter \n\n into eternal life; but if, after all that had been done for them, they \n\n still persisted in their wickedness, there remained for them an \n\n eternity of torment: hell. \n\n  \n\n The preacher's voice sank. He paused, joined his palms for an instant, \n\n parted them. Then he resumed: \n\n  \n\n --Now let us try for a moment to realize, as far as we can, the nature \n\n of that abode of the damned which the justice of an offended God has \n\n called into existence for the eternal punishment of sinners. Hell is a \n\n strait and dark and foul-smelling prison, an abode of demons and lost \n\n souls, filled with fire and smoke. The straitness of this prison house \n\n is expressly designed by God to punish those who refused to be bound by \n\n His laws. In earthly prisons the poor captive has at least some liberty \n\n of movement, were it only within the four walls of his cell or in the \n\n gloomy yard of his prison. Not so in hell. There, by reason of the \n\n great number of the damned, the prisoners are heaped together in their \n\n awful prison, the walls of which are said to be four thousand miles \n\n thick: and the damned are so utterly bound and helpless that, as a \n\n blessed saint, saint Anselm, writes in his book on similitudes, they \n\n are not even able to remove from the eye a worm that gnaws it. \n\n  \n\n --They lie in exterior darkness. For, remember, the fire of hell gives \n\n forth no light. As, at the command of God, the fire of the Babylonian \n\n furnace lost its heat but not its light, so, at the command of God, the \n\n fire of hell, while retaining the intensity of its heat, burns \n\n eternally in darkness. It is a never ending storm of darkness, dark \n\n flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are \n\n heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the \n\n plagues with which the land of the Pharaohs were smitten one plague \n\n alone, that of darkness, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we \n\n give to the darkness of hell which is to last not for three days alone \n\n but for all eternity? \n\n  \n\n --The horror of this strait and dark prison is increased by its awful \n\n stench. All the filth of the world, all the offal and scum of the \n\n world, we are told, shall run there as to a vast reeking sewer when the \n\n terrible conflagration of the last day has purged the world. The \n\n brimstone, too, which burns there in such prodigious quantity fills all \n\n hell with its intolerable stench; and the bodies of the damned \n\n themselves exhale such a pestilential odour that, as saint Bonaventure \n\n says, one of them alone would suffice to infect the whole world. The \n\n very air of this world, that pure element, becomes foul and \n\n unbreathable when it has been long enclosed. Consider then what must be \n\n the foulness of the air of hell. Imagine some foul and putrid corpse \n\n that has lain rotting and decomposing in the grave, a jelly-like mass \n\n of liquid corruption. Imagine such a corpse a prey to flames, devoured \n\n by the fire of burning brimstone and giving off dense choking fumes of \n\n nauseous loathsome decomposition. And then imagine this sickening \n\n stench, multiplied a millionfold and a millionfold again from the \n\n millions upon millions of fetid carcasses massed together in the \n\n reeking darkness, a huge and rotting human fungus. Imagine all this, \n\n and you will have some idea of the horror of the stench of hell. \n\n\n\n --But this stench is not, horrible though it is, the greatest physical \n\n torment to which the damned are subjected. The torment of fire is the \n\n greatest torment to which the tyrant has ever subjected his fellow \n\n creatures. Place your finger for a moment in the flame of a candle and \n\n you will feel the pain of fire. But our earthly fire was created by God \n\n for the benefit of man, to maintain in him the spark of life and to \n\n help him in the useful arts, whereas the fire of hell is of another \n\n quality and was created by God to torture and punish the unrepentant \n\n sinner. Our earthly fire also consumes more or less rapidly according \n\n as the object which it attacks is more or less combustible, so that \n\n human ingenuity has even succeeded in inventing chemical preparations \n\n to check or frustrate its action. But the sulphurous brimstone which \n\n burns in hell is a substance which is specially designed to burn for \n\n ever and for ever with unspeakable fury. Moreover, our earthly fire \n\n destroys at the same time as it burns, so that the more intense it is \n\n the shorter is its duration; but the fire of hell has this property, \n\n that it preserves that which it burns, and, though it rages with \n\n incredible intensity, it rages for ever. \n\n  \n\n --Our earthly fire again, no matter how fierce or widespread it may be, \n\n is always of a limited extent; but the lake of fire in hell is \n\n boundless, shoreless and bottomless. It is on record that the devil \n\n himself, when asked the question by a certain soldier, was obliged to \n\n confess that if a whole mountain were thrown into the burning ocean of \n\n hell it would be burned up In an instant like a piece of wax. And this \n\n terrible fire will not afflict the bodies of the damned only from \n\n without, but each lost soul will be a hell unto itself, the boundless \n\n fire raging in its very vitals. O, how terrible is the lot of those \n\n wretched beings! The blood seethes and boils in the veins, the brains \n\n are boiling in the skull, the heart in the breast glowing and bursting, \n\n the bowels a red-hot mass of burning pulp, the tender eyes flaming like \n\n molten balls. \n\n  \n\n --And yet what I have said as to the strength and quality and \n\n boundlessness of this fire is as nothing when compared to its \n\n intensity, an intensity which it has as being the instrument chosen by \n\n divine design for the punishment of soul and body alike. It is a fire \n\n which proceeds directly from the ire of God, working not of its own \n\n activity but as an instrument of Divine vengeance. As the waters of \n\n baptism cleanse the soul with the body, so do the fires of punishment \n\n torture the spirit with the flesh. Every sense of the flesh is tortured \n\n and every faculty of the soul therewith: the eyes with impenetrable \n\n utter darkness, the nose with noisome odours, the ears with yells and \n\n howls and execrations, the taste with foul matter, leprous corruption, \n\n nameless suffocating filth, the touch with redhot goads and spikes, \n\n with cruel tongues of flame. And through the several torments of the \n\n senses the immortal soul is tortured eternally in its very essence amid \n\n the leagues upon leagues of glowing fires kindled in the abyss by the \n\n offended majesty of the Omnipotent God and fanned into everlasting and \n\n ever-increasing fury by the breath of the anger of the God-head. \n\n  \n\n --Consider finally that the torment of this infernal prison is \n\n increased by the company of the damned themselves. Evil company on \n\n earth is so noxious that the plants, as if by instinct, withdraw from \n\n the company of whatsoever is deadly or hurtful to them. In hell all \n\n laws are overturned--there is no thought of family or country, of \n\n ties, of relationships. The damned howl and scream at one another, \n\n their torture and rage intensified by the presence of beings tortured \n\n and raging like themselves. All sense of humanity is forgotten. The \n\n yells of the suffering sinners fill the remotest corners of the vast \n\n abyss. The mouths of the damned are full of blasphemies against God and \n\n of hatred for their fellow sufferers and of curses against those souls \n\n which were their accomplices in sin. In olden times it was the custom \n\n to punish the parricide, the man who had raised his murderous hand \n\n against his father, by casting him into the depths of the sea in a sack \n\n in which were placed a cock, a monkey, and a serpent. The intention of \n\n those law-givers who framed such a law, which seems cruel in our times, \n\n was to punish the criminal by the company of hurtful and hateful \n\n beasts. But what is the fury of those dumb beasts compared with the \n\n fury of execration which bursts from the parched lips and aching \n\n throats of the damned in hell when they behold in their companions in \n\n misery those who aided and abetted them in sin, those whose words sowed \n\n the first seeds of evil thinking and evil living in their minds, those \n\n whose immodest suggestions led them on to sin, those whose eyes tempted \n\n and allured them from the path of virtue. They turn upon those \n\n accomplices and upbraid them and curse them. But they are helpless and \n\n hopeless: it is too late now for repentance. \n\n  \n\n --Last of all consider the frightful torment to those damned souls, \n\n tempters and tempted alike, of the company of the devils. These devils \n\n will afflict the damned in two ways, by their presence and by their \n\n reproaches. We can have no idea of how horrible these devils are. Saint \n\n Catherine of Siena once saw a devil and she has written that, rather \n\n than look again for one single instant on such a frightful monster, she \n\n would prefer to walk until the end of her life along a track of red \n\n coals. These devils, who were once beautiful angels, have become as \n\n hideous and ugly as they once were beautiful. They mock and jeer at the \n\n lost souls whom they dragged down to ruin. It is they, the foul demons, \n\n who are made in hell the voices of conscience. Why did you sin? Why did \n\n you lend an ear to the temptings of friends? Why did you turn aside \n\n from your pious practices and good works? Why did you not shun the \n\n occasions of sin? Why did you not leave that evil companion? Why did \n\n you not give up that lewd habit, that impure habit? Why did you not \n\n listen to the counsels of your confessor? Why did you not, even after \n\n you had fallen the first or the second or the third or the fourth or \n\n the hundredth time, repent of your evil ways and turn to God who only \n\n waited for your repentance to absolve you of your sins? Now the time \n\n for repentance has gone by. Time is, time was, but time shall be no more! \n\n Time was to sin in secrecy, to indulge in that sloth and pride, to \n\n covet the unlawful, to yield to the promptings of your lower nature, to \n\n live like the beasts of the field, nay worse than the beasts of the \n\n field, for they, at least, are but brutes and have no reason to guide \n\n them: time was, but time shall be no more. God spoke to you by so many \n\n voices, but you would not hear. You would not crush out that pride and \n\n anger in your heart, you would not restore those ill-gotten goods, you \n\n would not obey the precepts of your holy church nor attend to your \n\n religious duties, you would not abandon those wicked companions, you \n\n would not avoid those dangerous temptations. Such is the language of \n\n those fiendish tormentors, words of taunting and of reproach, of hatred \n\n and of disgust. Of disgust, yes! For even they, the very devils, when \n\n they sinned, sinned by such a sin as alone was compatible with such \n\n angelical natures, a rebellion of the intellect: and they, even they, \n\n the foul devils must turn away, revolted and disgusted, from the \n\n contemplation of those unspeakable sins by which degraded man outrages \n\n and defiles the temple of the Holy Ghost, defiles and pollutes himself. \n\n  \n\n --O, my dear little brothers in Christ, may it never be our lot to \n\n hear that language! May it never be our lot, I say! In the last day of \n\n terrible reckoning I pray fervently to God that not a single soul of \n\n those who are in this chapel today may be found among those miserable \n\n beings whom the Great Judge shall command to depart for ever from His \n\n sight, that not one of us may ever hear ringing in his ears the awful \n\n sentence of rejection: DEPART FROM ME, YE CURSED, INTO EVERLASTING FIRE \n\n WHICH WAS PREPARED FOR THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS! \n\n  \n\n He came down the aisle of the chapel, his legs shaking and the scalp of \n\n his head trembling as though it had been touched by ghostly fingers. He \n\n passed up the staircase and into the corridor along the walls of which \n\n the overcoats and waterproofs hung like gibbeted malefactors, headless \n\n and dripping and shapeless. And at every step he feared that he had \n\n already died, that his soul had been wrenched forth of the sheath of \n\n his body, that he was plunging headlong through space. \n\n  \n\n He could not grip the floor with his feet and sat heavily at his desk, \n\n opening one of his books at random and poring over it. Every word for \n\n him. It was true. God was almighty. God could call him now, call him as \n\n he sat at his desk, before he had time to be conscious of the summons. \n\n God had called him. Yes? What? Yes? His flesh shrank together as it \n\n felt the approach of the ravenous tongues of flames, dried up as it \n\n felt about it the swirl of stifling air. He had died. Yes. He was \n\n judged. A wave of fire swept through his body: the first. Again a wave. \n\n His brain began to glow. Another. His brain was simmering and bubbling \n\n within the cracking tenement of the skull. Flames burst forth from his \n\n skull like a corolla, shrieking like voices: \n\n  \n\n --Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! Hell! \n\n  \n\n Voices spoke near him: \n\n  \n\n --On hell. \n\n  \n\n --I suppose he rubbed it into you well. \n\n  \n\n --You bet he did. He put us all into a blue funk. \n\n  \n\n --That'S what you fellows want: and plenty of it to make you work. \n\n\n\n He leaned back weakly in his desk. He had not died. God had spared him \n\n still. He was still in the familiar world of the school. Mr Tate and \n\n Vincent Heron stood at the window, talking, jesting, gazing out at the \n\n bleak rain, moving their heads. \n\n  \n\n --I wish it would clear up. I had arranged to go for a spin on the \n\n bike with some fellows out by Malahide. But the roads must be \n\n knee-deep. \n\n  \n\n --It might clear up, sir. \n\n  \n\n The voices that he knew so well, the common words, the quiet of the \n\n classroom when the voices paused and the silence was filled by the \n\n sound of softly browsing cattle as the other boys munched their lunches \n\n tranquilly, lulled his aching soul. \n\n  \n\n There was still time. O Mary, refuge of sinners, intercede for him! O \n\n Virgin Undefiled, save him from the gulf of death! \n\n  \n\n The English lesson began with the hearing of the history. Royal \n\n persons, favourites, intriguers, bishops, passed like mute phantoms \n\n behind their veil of names. All had died: all had been judged. What did \n\n it profit a man to gain the whole world if he lost his soul? At last he \n\n had understood: and human life lay around him, a plain of peace whereon \n\n ant-like men laboured in brotherhood, their dead sleeping under quiet \n\n mounds. The elbow of his companion touched him and his heart was \n\n touched: and when he spoke to answer a question of his master he heard \n\n his own voice full of the quietude of humility and contrition. \n\n  \n\n His soul sank back deeper into depths of contrite peace, no longer able \n\n to suffer the pain of dread, and sending forth, as he sank, a faint \n\n prayer. Ah yes, he would still be spared; he would repent in his heart \n\n and be forgiven; and then those above, those in heaven, would see what \n\n he would do to make up for the past: a whole life, every hour of life. \n\n Only wait. \n\n  \n\n --All, God! All, all! \n\n  \n\n A messenger came to the door to say that confessions were being heard \n\n in the chapel. Four boys left the room; and he heard others passing \n\n down the corridor. A tremulous chill blew round his heart, no stronger \n\n than a little wind, and yet, listening and suffering silently, he \n\n seemed to have laid an ear against the muscle of his own heart, feeling \n\n it close and quail, listening to the flutter of its ventricles. \n\n  \n\n No escape. He had to confess, to speak out in words what he had done \n\n and thought, sin after sin. How? How? \n\n  \n\n --Father, I. \n\n  \n\n The thought slid like a cold shining rapier into his tender flesh: \n\n confession. But not there in the chapel of the college. He would \n\n confess all, every sin of deed and thought, sincerely; but not there \n\n among his school companions. Far away from there in some dark place he \n\n would murmur out his own shame; and he besought God humbly not to be \n\n offended with him if he did not dare to confess in the college chapel \n\n and in utter abjection of spirit he craved forgiveness mutely of the \n\n boyish hearts about him. \n\n  \n\n Time passed. \n\n  \n\n He sat again in the front bench of the chapel. The daylight without was \n\n already failing and, as it fell slowly through the dull red blinds, it \n\n seemed that the sun of the last day was going down and that all souls \n\n were being gathered for the judgement. \n\n  \n\n --I AM CAST AWAY FROM THE SIGHT OF THINE EYES: words taken, my dear \n\n little brothers in Christ, from the Book of Psalms, thirtieth chapter, \n\n twenty-third verse. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the \n\n Holy Ghost. Amen. \n\n  \n\n The preacher began to speak in a quiet friendly tone. His face was kind \n\n and he joined gently the fingers of each hand, forming a frail cage by \n\n the union of their tips. \n\n  \n\n --This morning we endeavoured, in our reflection upon hell, to make \n\n what our holy founder calls in his book of spiritual exercises, the \n\n composition of place. We endeavoured, that is, to imagine with the \n\n senses of the mind, in our imagination, the material character of that \n\n awful place and of the physical torments which all who are in hell endure. \n\n This evening we shall consider for a few moments the nature of the \n\n spiritual torments of hell. \n\n  \n\n --Sin, remember, is a twofold enormity. It is a base consent to the \n\n promptings of our corrupt nature to the lower instincts, to that which \n\n is gross and beast-like; and it is also a turning away from the counsel \n\n of our higher nature, from all that is pure and holy, from the Holy God \n\n Himself. For this reason mortal sin is punished in hell by two \n\n different forms of punishment, physical and spiritual. \n\n  \n\n Now of all these spiritual pains by far the greatest is the pain of \n\n loss, so great, in fact, that in itself it is a torment greater than \n\n all the others. Saint Thomas, the greatest doctor of the church, the \n\n angelic doctor, as he is called, says that the worst damnation consists \n\n in this, that the understanding of man is totally deprived of divine \n\n light and his affection obstinately turned away from the goodness of \n\n God. God, remember, is a being infinitely good, and therefore the loss \n\n of such a being must be a loss infinitely painful. In this life we have \n\n not a very clear idea of what such a loss must be, but the damned in \n\n hell, for their greater torment, have a full understanding of that \n\n which they have lost, and understand that they have lost it through \n\n their own sins and have lost it for ever. At the very instant of death \n\n the bonds of the flesh are broken asunder and the soul at once flies \n\n towards God as towards the centre of her existence. Remember, my dear \n\n little boys, our souls long to be with God. We come from God, we live \n\n by God, we belong to God: we are His, inalienably His. God loves with a \n\n divine love every human soul, and every human soul lives in that love. \n\n How could it be otherwise? Every breath that we draw, every thought of \n\n our brain, every instant of life proceeds from God's inexhaustible \n",
      "summary": "Father Arnall continues his sermon on hell and its torments, focusing on the spiritual aspects of damnation. He emphasizes the pain of loss as the greatest spiritual torment in hell, describing it as the deprivation of God's light and goodness. Stephen, deeply affected by the sermon, experiences intense fear and spiritual anguish. He contemplates confession but feels too ashamed to do so among his peers. The sermon concludes with a discussion on the nature of the soul's relationship with God and the agony of separation from Him.",

      "text": "He went up to his room after dinner in order to be alone with his soul, \n\n and at every step his soul seemed to sigh; at every step his soul \n\n mounted with his feet, sighing in the ascent, through a region of \n\n viscid gloom. \n\n  \n\n He halted on the landing before the door and then, grasping the \n\n porcelain knob, opened the door quickly. He waited in fear, his soul \n\n pining within him, praying silently that death might not touch his brow \n\n as he passed over the threshold, that the fiends that inhabit darkness \n\n might not be given power over him. He waited still at the threshold as \n\n at the entrance to some dark cave. Faces were there; eyes: they waited \n\n and watched. \n\n  \n\n --We knew perfectly well of course that though it was bound to come to \n\n the light he would find considerable difficulty in endeavouring to try \n\n to induce himself to try to endeavour to ascertain the spiritual \n\n plenipotentiary and so we knew of course perfectly well-- \n\n  \n\n Murmuring faces waited and watched; murmurous voices filled the dark \n\n shell of the cave. He feared intensely in spirit and in flesh but, \n\n raising his head bravely, he strode into the room firmly. A doorway, a \n\n room, the same room, same window. He told himself calmly that those \n\n words had absolutely no sense which had seemed to rise murmurously from \n\n the dark. He told himself that it was simply his room with the door \n\n open. \n\n  \n\n He closed the door and, walking swiftly to the bed, knelt beside it and \n\n covered his face with his hands. His hands were cold and damp and his \n\n limbs ached with chill. Bodily unrest and chill and weariness beset \n\n him, routing his thoughts. Why was he kneeling there like a child \n\n saying his evening prayers? To be alone with his soul, to examine his \n\n conscience, to meet his sins face to face, to recall their times and \n\n manners and circumstances, to weep over them. He could not weep. He \n\n could not summon them to his memory. He felt only an ache of soul and \n\n body, his whole being, memory, will, understanding, flesh, benumbed \n\n and weary. \n\n  \n\n That was the work of devils, to scatter his thoughts and over-cloud his \n\n conscience, assailing him at the gates of the cowardly and \n\n sin-corrupted flesh: and, praying God timidly to forgive him his \n\n weakness, he crawled up on to the bed and, wrapping the blankets \n\n closely about him, covered his face again with his hands. He had \n\n sinned. He had sinned so deeply against heaven and before God that he \n\n was not worthy to be called God's child. \n\n  \n\n Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? His \n\n conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, secretly, filthily, \n\n time after time, and, hardened in sinful impenitence, he had dared to \n\n wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soul \n\n within was a living mass of corruption. How came it that God had not \n\n struck him dead? The leprous company of his sins closed about him, \n\n breathing upon him, bending over him from all sides. He strove to \n\n forget them in an act of prayer, huddling his limbs closer together and \n\n binding down his eyelids: but the senses of his soul would not be bound \n\n and, though his eyes were shut fast, he saw the places where he had \n\n sinned and, though his ears were tightly covered, he heard. He desired \n\n with all his will not to hear or see. He desired till his frame shook \n\n under the strain of his desire and until the senses of his soul closed. \n\n They closed for an instant and then opened. He saw. \n\n  \n\n A field of stiff weeds and thistles and tufted nettle-bunches. Thick \n\n among the tufts of rank stiff growth lay battered canisters and clots \n\n and coils of solid excrement. A faint marshlight struggling upwards \n\n from all the ordure through the bristling grey-green weeds. An evil \n\n smell, faint and foul as the light, curled upwards sluggishly out of \n\n the canisters and from the stale crusted dung. \n\n  \n\n Creatures were in the field: one, three, six: creatures were moving in \n\n the field, hither and thither. Goatish creatures with human faces, \n\n hornybrowed, lightly bearded and grey as india-rubber. The malice of \n\n evil glittered in their hard eyes, as they moved hither and thither, \n\n trailing their long tails behind them. A rictus of cruel malignity lit \n\n up greyly their old bony faces. One was clasping about his ribs a torn \n\n flannel waistcoat, another complained monotonously as his beard stuck \n\n in the tufted weeds. Soft language issued from their spittleless lips \n\n as they swished in slow circles round and round the field, winding \n\n hither and thither through the weeds, dragging their long tails amid \n\n the rattling canisters. They moved in slow circles, circling closer and \n\n closer to enclose, to enclose, soft language issuing from their lips, \n\n their long swishing tails besmeared with stale shite, thrusting upwards \n\n their terrific faces \n\n  \n\n Help! \n\n  \n\n He flung the blankets from him madly to free his face and neck. That \n\n was his hell. God had allowed him to see the hell reserved for his \n\n sins: stinking, bestial, malignant, a hell of lecherous goatish fiends. \n\n For him! For him! \n\n  \n\n He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down his throat, \n\n clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of heaven! He \n\n stumbled towards the window, groaning and almost fainting with \n\n sickness. At the washstand a convulsion seized him within; and, \n\n clasping his cold forehead wildly, he vomited profusely in agony. \n\n\n\n When the fit had spent itself he walked weakly to the window and, \n\n lifting the sash, sat in a corner of the embrasure and leaned his elbow \n\n upon the sill. The rain had drawn off; and amid the moving vapours from \n\n point to point of light the city was spinning about herself a soft \n\n cocoon of yellowish haze. Heaven was still and faintly luminous and the \n\n air sweet to breathe, as in a thicket drenched with showers; and amid \n\n peace and shimmering lights and quiet fragrance he made a covenant with \n\n his heart. \n\n\n\n He prayed: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n --HE ONCE HAD MEANT TO COME ON EARTH IN HEAVENLY GLORY BUT WE SINNED; AND \n\n THEN HE COULD NOT SAFELY VISIT US BUT WITH A SHROUDED MAJESTY AND A \n\n BEDIMMED RADIANCE FOR HE WAS GOD. SO HE CAME HIMSELF IN WEAKNESS NOT IN \n\n POWER AND HE SENT THEE, A CREATURE IN HIS STEAD, WITH A CREATURES \n\n COMELINESS AND LUSTRE SUITED TO OUR STATE. AND NOW THY VERY FACE AND \n\n FORM, DEAR MOTHER SOAK TO US OF THE ETERNAL NOT LIKE EARTHLY BEAUTY, \n\n DANGEROUS TO LOOK UPON, BUT LIKE THE MORNING STAR WHICH IS THY EMBLEM, \n\n BRIGHT AND MUSICAL, BREATHING PURITY, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING \n\n PEACE. O HARBINGER OF DAY! O LIGHT OF THE PILGRIM! LEAD US STILL AS \n\n THOU HAST LED. IN THE DARK NIGHT, ACROSS THE BLEAK WILDERNESS GUIDE US \n\n ON TO OUR LORD JESUS, GUIDE US HOME. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n His eyes were dimmed with tears and, looking humbly up to heaven, he \n\n wept for the innocence he had lost. \n\n  \n\n When evening had fallen he left the house, and the first touch of the \n\n damp dark air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made \n\n ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer and tears. Confess! \n\n Confess! It was not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a \n\n prayer. He had to kneel before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tell \n\n over his hidden sins truly and repentantly. Before he heard again the \n\n footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to let \n\n him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he \n\n would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple. \n\n  \n\n The ache of conscience ceased and he walked onward swiftly through the \n\n dark streets. There were so many flagstones on the footpath of that \n\n street and so many streets in that City and so many cities in the \n\n world. Yet eternity had no end. He was in mortal sin. Even once was a \n\n mortal sin. It could happen in an instant. But how so quickly? By \n\n seeing or by thinking of seeing. The eyes see the thing, without having \n\n wished first to see. Then in an instant it happens. But does that part \n\n of the body understand or what? The serpent, the most subtle beast of \n\n the field. It must understand when it desires in one instant and then \n\n prolongs its own desire instant after instant, sinfully. It feels and \n\n understands and desires. What a horrible thing! Who made it to be like \n\n that, a bestial part of the body able to understand bestially and \n\n desire bestially? Was that then he or an inhuman thing moved by a lower \n\n soul? His soul sickened at the thought of a torpid snaky life feeding \n\n itself out of the tender marrow of his life and fattening upon the \n\n slime of lust. O why was that so? O why? \n\n  \n\n He cowered in the shadow of the thought, abasing himself in the awe of \n\n God Who had made all things and all men. Madness. Who could think such \n\n a thought? And, cowering in darkness and abject, he prayed mutely to \n\n his guardian angel to drive away with his sword the demon that was \n\n whispering to his brain. \n\n  \n\n The whisper ceased and he knew then clearly that his own soul had \n\n sinned in thought and word and deed wilfully through his own body. \n\n Confess! He had to confess every sin. How could he utter in words to \n\n the priest what he had done? Must, must. Or how could he explain \n\n without dying of shame? Or how could he have done such things without \n\n shame? A madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and sinless \n\n again! Perhaps the priest would know. O dear God! \n\n  \n\n He walked on and on through ill-lit streets, fearing to stand still for \n\n a moment lest it might seem that he held back from what awaited him, \n\n fearing to arrive at that towards which he still turned with longing. \n\n How beautiful must be a soul in the state of grace when God looked upon \n\n it with love! \n\n  \n\n Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets. Their dank \n\n hair hung trailed over their brows. They were not beautiful to see as \n\n they crouched in the mire. But their souls were seen by God; and if \n\n their souls were in a state of grace they were radiant to see: and God \n\n loved them, seeing them. \n\n  \n\n A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of \n\n how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were dearer to God than \n\n his. The wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of \n\n other souls on whom God's favour shone now more and now less, stars now \n\n brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing. And the glimmering souls \n\n passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. \n\n One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went \n\n out, forgotten, lost. The end: black, cold, void waste. \n\n  \n\n Consciousness of place came ebbing back to him slowly over a vast tract \n\n of time unlit, unfelt, unlived. The squalid scene composed itself \n\n around him; the common accents, the burning gas-jets in the shops, \n\n odours of fish and spirits and wet sawdust, moving men and women. An \n\n old woman was about to cross the street, an oilcan in her hand. He bent \n\n down and asked her was there a chapel near. \n\n  \n\n --A chapel, sir? Yes, sir. Church Street chapel. \n\n  \n\n --Church? \n\n  \n\n She shifted the can to her other hand and directed him; and, as she \n\n held out her reeking withered right hand under its fringe of shawl, he \n\n bent lower towards her, saddened and soothed by her voice. \n\n  \n\n --Thank you. \n\n  \n\n --You are quite welcome, sir. \n\n  \n\n The candles on the high altar had been extinguished but the fragrance \n\n of incense still floated down the dim nave. Bearded workmen with pious \n\n faces were guiding a canopy out through a side door, the sacristan \n\n aiding them with quiet gestures and words. A few of the faithful still \n\n lingered praying before one of the side-altars or kneeling in the \n\n benches near the confessionals. He approached timidly and knelt at the \n\n last bench in the body, thankful for the peace and silence and fragrant \n\n shadow of the church. The board on which he knelt was narrow and worn \n\n and those who knelt near him were humble followers of Jesus. Jesus too \n\n had been born in poverty and had worked in the shop of a carpenter, \n\n cutting boards and planing them, and had first spoken of the kingdom of \n\n God to poor fishermen, teaching all men to be meek and humble of heart. \n\n  \n\n He bowed his head upon his hands, bidding his heart be meek and humble \n\n that he might be like those who knelt beside him and his prayer as \n\n acceptable as theirs. He prayed beside them but it was hard. His soul \n\n was foul with sin and he dared not ask forgiveness with the simple \n\n trust of those whom Jesus, in the mysterious ways of God, had called \n\n first to His side, the carpenters, the fishermen, poor and simple \n\n people following a lowly trade, handling and shaping the wood of trees, \n\n mending their nets with patience. \n\n  \n\n A tall figure came down the aisle and the penitents stirred; and at the \n\n last moment, glancing up swiftly, he saw a long grey beard and the \n\n brown habit of a capuchin. The priest entered the box and was hidden. \n\n Two penitents rose and entered the confessional at either side. The \n\n wooden slide was drawn back and the faint murmur of a voice troubled \n\n the silence. \n\n  \n\n His blood began to murmur in his veins, murmuring like a sinful city \n\n summoned from its sleep to hear its doom. Little flakes of fire fell \n\n and powdery ashes fell softly, alighting on the houses of men. They \n\n stirred, waking from sleep, troubled by the heated air. \n\n  \n\n The slide was shot back. The penitent emerged from the side of the box. \n\n The farther side was drawn. A woman entered quietly and deftly where \n\n the first penitent had knelt. The faint murmur began again. \n\n  \n\n He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one foot before \n\n the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run swiftly through \n\n the dark streets. He could still escape from the shame. Had it been any \n\n terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! Little fiery \n\n flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful thoughts, shameful \n\n words, shameful acts. Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes \n\n falling continually. To say it in words! His soul, stifling and \n\n helpless, would cease to be. \n\n  \n\n The slide was shot back. A penitent emerged from the farther side of \n\n the box. The near slide was drawn. A penitent entered where the other \n\n penitent had come out. A soft whispering noise floated in vaporous \n\n cloudlets out of the box. It was the woman: soft whispering cloudlets, \n\n soft whispering vapour, whispering and vanishing. \n\n  \n\n He beat his breast with his fist humbly, secretly under cover of the \n\n wooden armrest. He would be at one with others and with God. He would \n\n love his neighbour. He would love God who had made and loved him. He \n\n would kneel and pray with others and be happy. God would look down on \n\n him and on them and would love them all. \n\n  \n\n It was easy to be good. God's yoke was sweet and light. It was better \n\n never to have sinned, to have remained always a child, for God loved \n\n little children and suffered them to come to Him. It was a terrible and \n\n a sad thing to sin. But God was merciful to poor sinners who were truly \n\n sorry. How true that was! That was indeed goodness. \n\n  \n\n The slide was shot to suddenly. The penitent came out. He was next. He \n\n stood up in terror and walked blindly into the box. \n\n  \n\n At last it had come. He knelt in the silent gloom and raised his eyes \n\n to the white crucifix suspended above him. God could see that he was \n\n sorry. He would tell all his sins. His confession would be long, long. \n\n Everybody in the chapel would know then what a sinner he had been. Let \n\n them know. It was true. But God had promised to forgive him if he was \n\n sorry. He was sorry. He clasped his hands and raised them towards the \n\n white form, praying with his darkened eyes, praying with all his \n\n trembling body, swaying his head to and fro like a lost creature, \n\n praying with whimpering lips. \n\n  \n\n --Sorry! Sorry! O sorry! \n\n  \n\n The slide clicked back and his heart bounded in his breast. The face of \n\n an old priest was at the grating, averted from him, leaning upon a \n",

      "text": "Sunday was dedicated to the mystery of the Holy Trinity, Monday to the \n\n Holy Ghost, Tuesday to the Guardian Angels, Wednesday to saint Joseph, \n\n Thursday to the Most Blessed Sacrament of the Altar, Friday to the \n\n Suffering Jesus, Saturday to the Blessed Virgin Mary. \n\n  \n\n Every morning he hallowed himself anew in the presence of some holy \n\n image or mystery. His day began with an heroic offering of its every \n\n moment of thought or action for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff \n\n and with an early mass. The raw morning air whetted his resolute piety; \n\n and often as he knelt among the few worshippers at the side-altar, \n\n following with his interleaved prayer-book the murmur of the priest, he \n\n glanced up for an instant towards the vested figure standing in the \n\n gloom between the two candles, which were the old and the new \n\n testaments, and imagined that he was kneeling at mass in the catacombs. \n\n  \n\n His daily life was laid out in devotional areas. By means of \n\n ejaculations and prayers he stored up ungrudgingly for the souls in \n\n purgatory centuries of days and quarantines and years; yet the \n\n spiritual triumph which he felt in achieving with ease so many fabulous \n\n ages of canonical penances did not wholly reward his zeal of prayer, \n\n since he could never know how much temporal punishment he had remitted \n\n by way of suffrage for the agonizing souls; and fearful lest in the \n\n midst of the purgatorial fire, which differed from the infernal only in \n\n that it was not everlasting, his penance might avail no more than a \n\n drop of moisture, he drove his soul daily through an increasing circle \n\n of works of supererogation. \n\n  \n\n Every part of his day, divided by what he regarded now as the duties of \n\n his station in life, circled about its own centre of spiritual energy. \n\n His life seemed to have drawn near to eternity; every thought, word, \n\n and deed, every instance of consciousness could be made to revibrate \n\n radiantly in heaven; and at times his sense of such immediate \n\n repercussion was so lively that he seemed to feel his soul in devotion \n\n pressing like fingers the keyboard of a great cash register and to see \n\n the amount of his purchase start forth immediately in heaven, not as a \n\n number but as a frail column of incense or as a slender flower. \n\n  \n\n The rosaries, too, which he said constantly--for he carried his beads \n\n loose in his trousers' pockets that he might tell them as he walked the \n\n streets--transformed themselves into coronals of flowers of such vague \n\n unearthly texture that they seemed to him as hueless and odourless as \n\n they were nameless. He offered up each of his three daily chaplets that \n\n his soul might grow strong in each of the three theological virtues, in \n\n faith in the Father Who had created him, in hope in the Son Who had \n\n redeemed him and in love of the Holy Ghost Who had sanctified him; and \n\n this thrice triple prayer he offered to the Three Persons through Mary \n\n in the name of her joyful and sorrowful and glorious mysteries. \n\n  \n\n On each of the seven days of the week he further prayed that one of the \n\n seven gifts of the Holy Ghost might descend upon his soul and drive out \n\n of it day by day the seven deadly sins which had defiled it in the \n\n past; and he prayed for each gift on its appointed day, confident that \n\n it would descend upon him, though it seemed strange to him at times \n\n that wisdom and understanding and knowledge were so distinct in their \n\n nature that each should be prayed for apart from the others. Yet he \n\n believed that at some future stage of his spiritual progress this \n\n difficulty would be removed when his sinful soul had been raised up \n\n from its weakness and enlightened by the Third Person of the Most \n\n Blessed Trinity. He believed this all the more, and with trepidation, \n\n because of the divine gloom and silence wherein dwelt the unseen \n\n Paraclete, Whose symbols were a dove and a mighty wind, to sin against \n\n Whom was a sin beyond forgiveness, the eternal mysterious secret Being \n\n to Whom, as God, the priests offered up mass once a year, robed in the \n\n scarlet of the tongues of fire. \n\n  \n\n The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the Three Persons \n\n of the Trinity were darkly shadowed forth in the books of devotion \n\n which he read--the Father contemplating from all eternity as in a \n\n mirror His Divine Perfections and thereby begetting eternally the \n\n Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit proceeding out of Father and Son from \n\n all eternity--were easier of acceptance by his mind by reason of their \n\n august incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved \n\n his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the \n\n world, for ages before the world itself had existed. \n\n  \n\n He had heard the names of the passions of love and hate pronounced \n\n solemnly on the stage and in the pulpit, had found them set forth \n\n solemnly in books and had wondered why his soul was unable to harbour \n\n them for any time or to force his lips to utter their names with \n\n conviction. A brief anger had often invested him but he had never been \n\n able to make it an abiding passion and had always felt himself passing \n\n out of it as if his very body were being divested with ease of some \n\n outer skin or peel. He had felt a subtle, dark, and murmurous presence \n\n penetrate his being and fire him with a brief iniquitous lust: it, too, \n\n had slipped beyond his grasp leaving his mind lucid and indifferent. \n\n This, it seemed, was the only love and that the only hate his soul \n\n would harbour. \n\n  \n\n But he could no longer disbelieve in the reality of love, since God \n\n Himself had loved his individual soul with divine love from all \n\n eternity. Gradually, as his soul was enriched with spiritual knowledge, \n\n he saw the whole world forming one vast symmetrical expression of God's \n\n power and love. Life became a divine gift for every moment and \n\n sensation of which, were it even the sight of a single leaf hanging on \n\n the twig of a tree, his soul should praise and thank the Giver. The \n\n world for all its solid substance and complexity no longer existed for \n\n his soul save as a theorem of divine power and love and universality. \n\n So entire and unquestionable was this sense of the divine meaning in \n\n all nature granted to his soul that he could scarcely understand why it \n\n was in any way necessary that he should continue to live. Yet that was \n\n part of the divine purpose and he dared not question its use, he above \n\n all others who had sinned so deeply and so foully against the divine \n\n purpose. Meek and abased by this consciousness of the one eternal \n\n omnipresent perfect reality his soul took up again her burden of \n\n pieties, masses and prayers and sacraments and mortifications, and only \n\n then for the first time since he had brooded on the great mystery of \n\n love did he feel within him a warm movement like that of some newly \n\n born life or virtue of the soul itself. The attitude of rapture in \n\n sacred art, the raised and parted hands, the parted lips and eyes as of \n\n one about to swoon, became for him an image of the soul in prayer, \n\n humiliated and faint before her Creator. \n\n  \n\n But he had been forewarned of the dangers of spiritual exaltation and \n\n did not allow himself to desist from even the least or lowliest \n\n devotion, striving also by constant mortification to undo the sinful \n\n past rather than to achieve a saintliness fraught with peril. Each of \n\n his senses was brought under a rigorous discipline. In order to mortify \n\n the sense of sight he made it his rule to walk in the street with \n\n downcast eyes, glancing neither to right nor left and never behind him. \n\n His eyes shunned every encounter with the eyes of women. From time to \n\n time also he balked them by a sudden effort of the will, as by lifting \n\n them suddenly in the middle of an unfinished sentence and closing the \n\n book. To mortify his hearing he exerted no control over his voice which \n\n was then breaking, neither sang nor whistled, and made no attempt to \n\n flee from noises which caused him painful nervous irritation such as \n\n the sharpening of knives on the knife board, the gathering of cinders \n\n on the fire-shovel and the twigging of the carpet. To mortify his smell \n\n was more difficult as he found in himself no instinctive repugnance to \n\n bad odours whether they were the odours of the outdoor world, such as \n\n those of dung or tar, or the odours of his own person among which he \n\n had made many curious comparisons and experiments. He found in the end \n\n that the only odour against which his sense of smell revolted was a \n\n certain stale fishy stink like that of long-standing urine; and \n\n whenever it was possible he subjected himself to this unpleasant odour. \n\n To mortify the taste he practised strict habits at table, observed to \n\n the letter all the fasts of the church and sought by distraction to \n\n divert his mind from the savours of different foods. But it was to the \n\n mortification of touch he brought the most assiduous ingenuity of \n\n inventiveness. He never consciously changed his position in bed, sat in \n\n the most uncomfortable positions, suffered patiently every itch and \n\n pain, kept away from the fire, remained on his knees all through the \n\n mass except at the gospels, left part of his neck and face undried so \n\n that air might sting them and, whenever he was not saying his beads, \n\n carried his arms stiffly at his sides like a runner and never in his \n\n pockets or clasped behind him. \n\n  \n\n He had no temptations to sin mortally. It surprised him however to find \n\n that at the end of his course of intricate piety and self-restraint he \n\n was so easily at the mercy of childish and unworthy imperfections. His \n\n prayers and fasts availed him little for the suppression of anger at \n\n hearing his mother sneeze or at being disturbed in his devotions. It \n\n needed an immense effort of his will to master the impulse which urged \n\n him to give outlet to such irritation. Images of the outbursts of \n\n trivial anger which he had often noted among his masters, their \n\n twitching mouths, close-shut lips and flushed cheeks, recurred to his \n\n memory, discouraging him, for all his practice of humility, by the \n\n comparison. To merge his life in the common tide of other lives was \n\n harder for him than any fasting or prayer and it was his constant \n\n failure to do this to his own satisfaction which caused in his soul at \n\n last a sensation of spiritual dryness together with a growth of doubts \n\n and scruples. His soul traversed a period of desolation in which the \n\n sacraments themselves seemed to have turned into dried-up sources. His \n\n confession became a channel for the escape of scrupulous and unrepented \n\n imperfections. His actual reception of the eucharist did not bring him \n\n the same dissolving moments of virginal self-surrender as did those \n\n spiritual communions made by him sometimes at the close of some visit \n\n to the Blessed Sacrament. The book which he used for these visits was \n\n an old neglected book written by saint Alphonsus Liguori, with fading \n\n characters and sere foxpapered leaves. A faded world of fervent love \n\n and virginal responses seemed to be evoked for his soul by the reading \n\n of its pages in which the imagery of the canticles was interwoven with \n\n the communicant's prayers. An inaudible voice seemed to caress the \n\n soul, telling her names and glories, bidding her arise as for espousal \n\n and come away, bidding her look forth, a spouse, from Amana and from \n\n the mountains of the leopards; and the soul seemed to answer with the \n\n same inaudible voice, surrendering herself: INTER UBERA MEA \n\n COMMORABITUR. \n\n  \n\n This idea of surrender had a perilous attraction for his mind now that \n\n he felt his soul beset once again by the insistent voices of the flesh \n\n which began to murmur to him again during his prayers and meditations. \n\n It gave him an intense sense of power to know that he could, by a \n\n single act of consent, in a moment of thought, undo all that he had \n\n done. He seemed to feel a flood slowly advancing towards his naked feet \n\n and to be waiting for the first faint timid noiseless wavelet to touch \n\n his fevered skin. Then, almost at the instant of that touch, almost at \n\n the verge of sinful consent, he found himself standing far away from \n\n the flood upon a dry shore, saved by a sudden act of the will or a \n\n sudden ejaculation; and, seeing the silver line of the flood far away \n\n and beginning again its slow advance towards his feet, a new thrill of \n\n power and satisfaction shook his soul to know that he had not yielded \n\n nor undone all. \n\n  \n\n When he had eluded the flood of temptation many times in this way he \n\n grew troubled and wondered whether the grace which he had refused to \n\n lose was not being filched from him little by little. The clear \n\n certitude of his own immunity grew dim and to it succeeded a vague fear \n\n that his soul had really fallen unawares. It was with difficulty that \n\n he won back his old consciousness of his state of grace by telling \n\n himself that he had prayed to God at every temptation and that the \n\n grace which he had prayed for must have been given to him inasmuch as \n\n God was obliged to give it. The very frequency and violence of \n\n temptations showed him at last the truth of what he had heard about the \n\n trials of the saints. Frequent and violent temptations were a proof \n\n that the citadel of the soul had not fallen and that the devil raged to \n\n make it fall. \n\n  \n\n Often when he had confessed his doubts and scruples--some momentary \n\n inattention at prayer, a movement of trivial anger in his soul, or a \n\n subtle wilfulness in speech or act--he was bidden by his confessor to \n\n name some sin of his past life before absolution was given him. He \n\n named it with humility and shame and repented of it once more. It \n\n humiliated and shamed him to think that he would never be freed from it \n\n wholly, however holily he might live or whatever virtues or perfections \n\n he might attain. A restless feeling of guilt would always be present \n\n with him: he would confess and repent and be absolved, confess and \n\n repent again and be absolved again, fruitlessly. Perhaps that first \n\n hasty confession wrung from him by the fear of hell had not been good? \n\n Perhaps, concerned only for his imminent doom, he had not had sincere \n\n sorrow for his sin? But the surest sign that his confession had been \n\n good and that he had had sincere sorrow for his sin was, he knew, the \n\n amendment of his life. \n\n  \n\n --I have amended my life, have I not? he asked himself \n\n  \n\n The director stood in the embrasure of the window, his back to the \n\n light, leaning an elbow on the brown crossblind, and, as he spoke and \n\n smiled, slowly dangling and looping the cord of the other blind, \n\n Stephen stood before him, following for a moment with his eyes the \n\n waning of the long summer daylight above the roofs or the slow deft \n\n movements of the priestly fingers. The priest's face was in total \n\n shadow, but the waning daylight from behind him touched the deeply \n\n grooved temples and the curves of the skull. \n\n  \n\n Stephen followed also with his ears the accents and intervals of the \n\n priest's voice as he spoke gravely and cordially of indifferent themes, \n\n the vacation which had just ended, the colleges of the order abroad, \n\n the transference of masters. The grave and cordial voice went on easily \n\n with its tale and in the pauses Stephen felt bound to set it on again \n\n with respectful questions. He knew that the tale was a prelude and his \n\n mind waited for the sequel. Ever since the message of summons had come \n\n for him from the director his mind had struggled to find the meaning of \n\n the message; and, during the long restless time he had sat in the \n\n college parlour waiting for the director to come in, his eyes had \n\n wandered from one sober picture to another around the walls and his \n\n mind wandered from one guess to another until the meaning of the \n\n summons had almost become clear. Then, just as he was wishing that some \n\n unforeseen cause might prevent the director from coming, he had heard \n\n the handle of the door turning and the swish of a soutane. \n\n  \n\n The director had begun to speak of the dominican and franciscan orders \n\n and of the friendship between saint Thomas and saint Bonaventure. The \n\n capuchin dress, he thought, was rather too \n\n  \n\n Stephen's face gave back the priest's indulgent smile and, not being \n\n anxious to give an opinion, he made a slight dubitative movement with \n\n his lips. \n\n  \n\n --I believe, continued the director, that there is some talk now among \n\n the capuchins themselves of doing away with it and following the \n\n example of the other franciscans. \n\n  \n\n --I suppose they would retain it in the cloisters? said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --O certainly, said the director. For the cloister it is all right but \n\n for the street I really think it would be better to do away with it, \n\n don't you? \n\n  \n\n --It must be troublesome, I imagine. \n\n  \n\n --Of course it is, of course. Just imagine when I was in Belgium I \n\n used to see them out cycling in all kinds of weather with this thing up \n\n about their knees! It was really ridiculous. LES JUPES, they call them \n\n in Belgium. \n\n  \n\n The vowel was so modified as to be indistinct. \n\n  \n\n --What do they call them? \n\n  \n\n --LES JUPES. \n\n  \n\n --O! \n\n  \n\n Stephen smiled again in answer to the smile which he could not see on \n\n the priest's shadowed face, its image or spectre only passing rapidly \n\n across his mind as the low discreet accent fell upon his ear. He gazed \n\n calmly before him at the waning sky, glad of the cool of the evening \n\n and of the faint yellow glow which hid the tiny flame kindling upon his \n\n cheek. \n\n  \n\n The names of articles of dress worn by women or of certain soft and \n\n delicate stuffs used in their making brought always to his mind a \n\n delicate and sinful perfume. As a boy he had imagined the reins by \n\n which horses are driven as slender silken bands and it shocked him to \n\n feel at Stradbrooke the greasy leather of harness. It had shocked him, \n\n too, when he had felt for the first time beneath his tremulous fingers \n\n the brittle texture of a woman's stocking for, retaining nothing of all \n\n he read save that which seemed to him an echo or a prophecy of his own \n\n state, it was only amid soft-worded phrases or within rose-soft stuff's \n\n that he dared to conceive of the soul or body of a woman moving with \n\n tender life. \n\n  \n\n But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he knew that a \n\n priest should not speak lightly on that theme. The phrase had been \n\n spoken lightly with design and he felt that his face was being searched \n\n by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever he had heard or read of the craft \n\n of jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his own \n\n experience. His masters, even when they had not attracted him, \n\n had seemed to him always intelligent and serious priests, \n\n athletic and high-spirited prefects. He thought of them as men \n\n who washed their bodies briskly with cold water and wore clean cold \n\n linen. During all the years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in \n\n Belvedere he had received only two pandies and, though these had been \n\n dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped punishment. \n\n During all those years he had never heard from any of his masters a \n\n flippant word: it was they who had taught him christian doctrine and \n\n urged him to live a good life and, when he had fallen into grievous \n\n sin, it was they who had led him back to grace. Their presence had made \n\n him diffident of himself when he was a muffin Clongowes and it had made \n\n him diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal position \n\n in Belvedere. A constant sense of this had remained with him up to the \n\n last year of his school life. He had never once disobeyed or allowed \n\n turbulent companions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience; \n\n and, even when he doubted some statement of a master, he had never \n\n presumed to doubt openly. Lately some of their judgements had sounded a \n\n little childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as \n\n though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were \n\n hearing its language for the last time. One day when some boys had \n\n gathered round a priest under the shed near the chapel, he had heard \n\n the priest say: \n\n  \n\n --I believe that Lord Macaulay was a man who probably never committed \n\n a mortal sin in his life, that is to say, a deliberate mortal sin. \n\n  \n\n Some of the boys had then asked the priest if Victor Hugo were not the \n\n greatest French writer. The priest had answered that Victor Hugo had \n\n never written half so well when he had turned against the church as he \n\n had written when he was a catholic. \n\n  \n\n --But there are many eminent French critics, said the priest, who \n\n consider that even Victor Hugo, great as he certainly was, had not so \n\n pure a French style as Louis Veuillot. \n\n  \n\n The tiny flame which the priest's allusion had kindled upon Stephen's \n\n cheek had sunk down again and his eyes were still fixed calmly on the \n\n colourless sky. But an unresting doubt flew hither and thither before \n\n his mind. Masked memories passed quickly before him: he recognized \n\n scenes and persons yet he was conscious that he had failed to perceive \n\n some vital circumstance in them. He saw himself walking about the \n\n grounds watching the sports in Clongowes and eating slim jim out of his \n\n cricket cap. Some jesuits were walking round the cycle-track in the \n\n company of ladies. The echoes of certain expressions used in Clongowes \n\n sounded in remote caves of his mind. \n\n  \n\n His ears were listening to these distant echoes amid the silence of the \n\n parlour when he became aware that the priest was addressing him in a \n\n different voice. \n\n  \n\n --I sent for you today, Stephen, because I wished to speak to you on a \n\n very important subject. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, sir. \n\n  \n\n --Have you ever felt that you had a vocation? \n\n  \n\n Stephen parted his lips to answer yes and then withheld the word \n\n suddenly. The priest waited for the answer and added: \n\n  \n\n --I mean, have you ever felt within yourself, in your soul, a desire \n\n to join the order? Think. \n\n  \n\n --I have sometimes thought of it, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n The priest let the blindcord fall to one side and, uniting his hands, \n\n leaned his chin gravely upon them, communing with himself. \n\n  \n\n --In a college like this, he said at length, there is one boy or perhaps \n\n two or three boys whom God calls to the religious life. Such a boy is \n\n marked off from his companions by his piety, by the good example he \n\n shows to others. He is looked up to by them; he is chosen perhaps as \n\n prefect by his fellow sodalists. And you, Stephen, have been such a boy \n\n in this college, prefect of Our Blessed Lady's sodality. Perhaps you \n\n are the boy in this college whom God designs to call to Himself. \n\n  \n\n A strong note of pride reinforcing the gravity of the priest's voice \n\n made Stephen's heart quicken in response. \n\n  \n\n To receive that call, Stephen, said the priest, is the greatest honour \n\n that the Almighty God can bestow upon a man. No king or emperor on this \n\n earth has the power of the priest of God. No angel or archangel in \n\n heaven, no saint, not even the Blessed Virgin herself, has the power of \n\n a priest of God: the power of the keys, the power to bind and to loose \n\n from sin, the power of exorcism, the power to cast out from the \n\n creatures of God the evil spirits that have power over them; the power, \n\n the authority, to make the great God of Heaven come down upon the altar \n\n and take the form of bread and wine. What an awful power, Stephen! \n\n  \n\n A flame began to flutter again on Stephen's cheek as he heard in this \n\n proud address an echo of his own proud musings. How often had he seen \n\n himself as a priest wielding calmly and humbly the awful power \n\n of which angels and saints stood in reverence! His soul had loved \n\n to muse in secret on this desire. He had seen himself, a young \n\n and silent-mannered priest, entering a confessional swiftly, \n\n ascending the altarsteps, incensing, genuflecting, accomplishing \n\n the vague acts of the priesthood which pleased him by reason of \n\n their semblance of reality and of their distance from it. In that \n\n dim life which he had lived through in his musings he had \n\n assumed the voices and gestures which he had noted with various \n\n priests. He had bent his knee sideways like such a one, he had \n\n shaken the thurible only slightly like such a one, his chasuble had \n\n swung open like that of such another as he turned to the altar again \n\n after having blessed the people. And above all it had pleased him to \n\n fill the second place in those dim scenes of his imagining. He shrank \n\n from the dignity of celebrant because it displeased him to imagine that \n\n all the vague pomp should end in his own person or that the ritual \n\n should assign to him so clear and final an office. He longed for the \n\n minor sacred offices, to be vested with the tunicle of subdeacon at \n\n high mass, to stand aloof from the altar, forgotten by the people, his \n\n shoulders covered with a humeral veil, holding the paten within its \n\n folds or, when the sacrifice had been accomplished, to stand as deacon \n\n in a dalmatic of cloth of gold on the step below the celebrant, his \n\n hands joined and his face towards the people, and sing the chant ITE \n\n MISSA EST. If ever he had seen himself celebrant it was as in the \n\n pictures of the mass in his child's massbook, in a church without \n\n worshippers, save for the angel of the sacrifice, at a bare altar, and \n\n served by an acolyte scarcely more boyish than himself. In vague \n\n sacrificial or sacramental acts alone his will seemed drawn to go forth \n\n to encounter reality; and it was partly the absence of an appointed \n\n rite which had always constrained him to inaction whether he had \n\n allowed silence to cover his anger or pride or had suffered only an \n\n embrace he longed to give. \n\n  \n\n He listened in reverent silence now to the priest's appeal and through \n\n the words he heard even more distinctly a voice bidding him approach, \n\n offering him secret knowledge and secret power. He would know then what \n\n was the sin of Simon Magus and what the sin against the Holy Ghost for \n\n which there was no forgiveness. He would know obscure things, hidden \n\n from others, from those who were conceived and born children of wrath. \n\n He would know the sins, the sinful longings and sinful thoughts and \n\n sinful acts, of others, hearing them murmured into his ears in the \n\n confessional under the shame of a darkened chapel by the lips of women \n\n and of girls; but rendered immune mysteriously at his ordination by the \n\n imposition of hands, his soul would pass again uncontaminated to the \n\n white peace of the altar. No touch of sin would linger upon the hands \n\n with which he would elevate and break the host; no touch of sin would \n\n linger on his lips in prayer to make him eat and drink damnation to \n\n himself not discerning the body of the Lord. He would hold his secret \n\n knowledge and secret power, being as sinless as the innocent, and he \n\n would be a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec. \n\n  \n\n --I will offer up my mass tomorrow morning, said the director, that \n\n Almighty God may reveal to you His holy will. And let you, Stephen, \n\n make a novena to your holy patron saint, the first martyr, who is very \n\n powerful with God, that God may enlighten your mind. But you must be \n\n quite sure, Stephen, that you have a vocation because it would be \n\n terrible if you found afterwards that you had none. Once a priest \n\n always a priest, remember. Your catechism tells you that the sacrament \n\n of Holy Orders is one of those which can be received only once because \n\n it imprints on the soul an indelible spiritual mark which can never be \n\n effaced. It is before you must weigh well, not after. It is a solemn \n\n question, Stephen, because on it may depend the salvation of your \n\n eternal soul. But we will pray to God together. \n\n  \n\n He held open the heavy hall door and gave his hand as if already to a \n\n companion in the spiritual life. Stephen passed out on to the wide \n\n platform above the steps and was conscious of the caress of mild \n\n evening air. Towards Findlater's church a quartet of young men were \n\n striding along with linked arms, swaying their heads and stepping to \n\n the agile melody of their leader's concertina. The music passed in an \n\n instant, as the first bars of sudden music always did, over the \n\n fantastic fabrics of his mind, dissolving them painlessly and \n\n noiselessly as a sudden wave dissolves the sand-built turrets of \n\n children. Smiling at the trivial air he raised his eyes to the priest's \n\n face and, seeing in it a mirthless reflection of the sunken day, \n\n detached his hand slowly which had acquiesced faintly in the \n\n companionship. \n\n  \n\n As he descended the steps the impression which effaced his troubled \n\n self-communion was that of a mirthless mask reflecting a sunken day \n\n from the threshold of the college. The shadow, then, of the life of the \n\n college passed gravely over his consciousness. It was a grave and \n\n ordered and passionless life that awaited him, a life without material \n\n cares. He wondered how he would pass the first night in the novitiate \n\n and with what dismay he would wake the first morning in the dormitory. \n\n The troubling odour of the long corridors of Clongowes came back to him \n\n and he heard the discreet murmur of the burning gasflames. At once from \n\n every part of his being unrest began to irradiate. A feverish \n\n quickening of his pulses followed, and a din of meaningless words drove \n\n his reasoned thoughts hither and thither confusedly. His lungs dilated \n\n and sank as if he were inhaling a warm moist unsustaining air and he \n\n smelt again the moist warm air which hung in the bath in Clongowes \n\n above the sluggish turf-coloured water. \n\n  \n\n Some instinct, waking at these memories, stronger than education or \n\n piety, quickened within him at every near approach to that life, an \n\n instinct subtle and hostile, and armed him against acquiescence. The \n\n chill and order of the life repelled him. He saw himself rising in the \n\n cold of the morning and filing down with the others to early mass and \n\n trying vainly to struggle with his prayers against the fainting \n\n sickness of his stomach. He saw himself sitting at dinner with the \n\n community of a college. What, then, had become of that deep-rooted \n\n shyness of his which had made him loth to eat or drink under a strange \n\n roof? What had come of the pride of his spirit which had always made \n\n him conceive himself as a being apart in every order? \n\n  \n\n The Reverend Stephen Dedalus, S.J. \n\n  \n\n His name in that new life leaped into characters before his eyes and to \n\n it there followed a mental sensation of an undefined face or colour of \n\n a face. The colour faded and became strong like a changing glow of \n\n pallid brick red. Was it the raw reddish glow he had so often seen on \n\n wintry mornings on the shaven gills of the priests? The face was \n\n eyeless and sour-favoured and devout, shot with pink tinges of \n\n suffocated anger. Was it not a mental spectre of the face of one of the \n\n jesuits whom some of the boys called Lantern Jaws and others Foxy \n\n Campbell? \n\n  \n\n He was passing at that moment before the jesuit house in Gardiner \n\n Street and wondered vaguely which window would be his if he ever joined \n\n the order. Then he wondered at the vagueness of his wonder, at the \n\n remoteness of his own soul from what he had hitherto imagined her \n\n sanctuary, at the frail hold which so many years of order and obedience \n\n had of him when once a definite and irrevocable act of his threatened \n\n to end for ever, in time and in eternity, his freedom. The voice of the \n\n director urging upon him the proud claims of the church and the mystery \n\n and power of the priestly office repeated itself idly in his memory. \n\n His soul was not there to hear and greet it and he knew now that the \n\n exhortation he had listened to had already fallen into an idle formal \n\n tale. He would never swing the thurible before the tabernacle as priest. \n\n His destiny was to be elusive of social or religious orders. The wisdom of \n\n the priest's appeal did not touch him to the quick. He was destined to \n\n learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others \n\n himself wandering among the snares of the world. \n\n  \n\n The snares of the world were its ways of sin. He would fall. He had not \n\n yet fallen but he would fall silently, in an instant. Not to fall was \n\n too hard, too hard; and he felt the silent lapse of his soul, as it \n\n would be at some instant to come, falling, falling, but not yet fallen, \n\n still unfallen, but about to fall. \n\n  \n\n He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and turned his",

      "text": "He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing \n\n the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into \n\n the dark pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had been scooped out like \n\n a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the dark \n\n turf-coloured water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn tickets \n\n at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another \n\n in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded \n\n and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy. \n\n  \n\n 1 Pair Buskins. \n\n  \n\n 1 D. Coat. \n\n  \n\n 3 Articles and White. \n\n  \n\n 1 Man's Pants. \n\n  \n\n Then he put them aside and gazed thoughtfully at the lid of the box, \n\n speckled with louse marks, and asked vaguely: \n\n  \n\n --How much is the clock fast now? \n\n  \n\n His mother straightened the battered alarm clock that was lying on its \n\n side in the middle of the mantelpiece until its dial showed a quarter \n\n to twelve and then laid it once more on its side. \n\n  \n\n --An hour and twenty-five minutes, she said. The right time now is \n\n twenty past ten. The dear knows you might try to be in time for your \n\n lectures. \n\n  \n\n --Fill out the place for me to wash, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Katey, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. \n\n  \n\n --Boody, fill out the place for Stephen to wash. \n\n  \n\n --I can't, I'm going for blue. Fill it out, you, Maggy. \n\n  \n\n When the enamelled basin had been fitted into the well of the sink and \n\n the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to \n\n scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the \n\n interstices at the wings of his nose. \n\n  \n\n --Well, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is so \n\n dirty that his mother has to wash him. \n\n  \n\n --But it gives you pleasure, said Stephen calmly. \n\n  \n\n An ear-splitting whistle was heard from upstairs and his mother thrust \n\n a damp overall into his hands, saying: \n\n  \n\n --Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of goodness. \n\n  \n\n A second shrill whistle, prolonged angrily, brought one of the girls to \n\n the foot of the staircase. \n\n  \n\n --Yes, father? \n\n  \n\n --Is your lazy bitch of a brother gone out yet? \n\n  \n\n --Yes, father. \n\n  \n\n --Sure? \n\n  \n\n --Yes, father. \n\n  \n\n --Hm! \n\n  \n\n The girl came back, making signs to him to be quick and go out quietly \n\n by the back. Stephen laughed and said: \n\n  \n\n --He has a curious idea of genders if he thinks a bitch is masculine. \n\n  \n\n --Ah, it's a scandalous shame for you, Stephen, said his mother, and \n\n you'll live to rue the day you set your foot in that place. I know how \n\n it has changed you. \n\n  \n\n --Good morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and kissing the tips \n\n of his fingers in adieu. \n\n  \n\n The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it \n\n slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of wet rubbish, he heard a mad \n\n nun screeching in the nuns' madhouse beyond the wall. \n\n  \n\n --Jesus! O Jesus! Jesus! \n\n  \n\n He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and \n\n hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already \n\n bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his \n\n mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so \n\n many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. \n\n He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as \n\n he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about \n\n him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the \n\n wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries. \n\n  \n\n The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories \n\n of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the \n\n memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet \n\n branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the \n\n city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of \n\n Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; \n\n that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the \n\n windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of \n\n Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting \n\n works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a \n\n keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy \n\n marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben \n\n Jonson which begins: \n\n  \n\n  I was not wearier where I lay. \n\n  \n\n His mind when wearied of its search for the essence of beauty amid the \n\n spectral words of Aristotle or Aquinas turned often for its pleasure to \n\n the dainty songs of the Elizabethans. His mind, in the vesture of a \n\n doubting monk, stood often in shadow under the windows of that age, to \n\n hear the grave and mocking music of the lutenists or the frank laughter \n\n of waist-coateers until a laugh too low, a phrase, tarnished by time, \n\n of chambering and false honour stung his monkish pride and drove him on \n\n from his lurking-place. \n\n  \n\n The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that \n\n it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of \n\n slender sentences from Aristotle's poetics and psychology and a \n\n SYNOPSIS PHILOSOPHIAE SCHOLASTICAE AD MENTEM DIVI THOMAE. His thinking \n\n was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the \n\n lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in \n\n those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been \n\n fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes \n\n of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty \n\n had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had \n\n been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of \n\n silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself \n\n still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor \n\n and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a light heart. \n\n  \n\n Near the hoardings on the canal he met the consumptive man with the \n\n doll's face and the brimless hat coming towards him down the slope of \n\n the bridge with little steps, tightly buttoned into his chocolate \n\n overcoat, and holding his furled umbrella a span or two from him like a \n\n divining rod. It must be eleven, he thought, and peered into a dairy to \n\n see the time. The clock in the dairy told him that it was five minutes \n\n to five but, as he turned away, he heard a clock somewhere near him, \n\n but unseen, beating eleven strokes in swift precision. He laughed as he \n\n heard it for it made him think of McCann, and he saw him a squat figure \n\n in a shooting jacket and breeches and with a fair goatee, standing in \n\n the wind at Hopkins' corner, and heard him say: \n\n  \n\n --Dedalus, you're an antisocial being, wrapped up in yourself. I'm \n\n not. I'm a democrat and I `Il work and act for social liberty and \n\n equality among all classes and sexes in the United States of the Europe \n\n of the future. \n\n  \n\n Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was \n\n it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. \n\n Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to \n\n one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even \n\n at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his \n\n classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they \n\n were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and \n\n examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an \n\n unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his \n\n thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class \n\n of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the \n\n green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another \n\n head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised \n\n squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing \n\n without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about \n\n him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise \n\n before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the \n\n head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw \n\n it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head \n\n or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as \n\n by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, \n\n in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the \n\n jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly \n\n smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all \n\n the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and \n\n night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, \n\n would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who \n\n heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he \n\n felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes. \n\n  \n\n Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange dark cavern of \n\n speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not \n\n yet the hour to enter it. But the nightshade of his friend's \n\n listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and \n\n deadly exhalation and be found himself glancing from one casual word to \n\n another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so \n\n silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend \n\n bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up \n\n sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead \n\n language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain \n\n and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and \n\n disband themselves in wayward rhythms: \n\n  \n\n  The ivy whines upon the wall, \n\n  And whines and twines upon the wall, \n\n  The yellow ivy upon the wall, \n\n  Ivy, ivy up the wall. \n\n  \n\n Did anyone ever hear such drivel? Lord Almighty! Who ever heard of ivy \n\n whining on a wall? Yellow ivy; that was all right. Yellow ivory also. \n\n And what about ivory ivy? \n\n  \n\n The word now shone in his brain, clearer and brighter than any ivory \n\n sawn from the mottled tusks of elephants. IVORY, IVOIRE, AVORIO, EBUR. \n\n One of the first examples that he had learnt in Latin had run: \n\n INDIA MITTIT EBUR; and he recalled the shrewd northern face of the \n\n rector who had taught him to construe the Metamorphoses of Ovid in a \n\n courtly English, made whimsical by the mention of porkers and potsherds \n\n and chines of bacon. He had learnt what little he knew of the laws of \n\n Latin verse from a ragged book written by a Portuguese priest. \n\n  \n\n  Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates. \n\n  \n\n The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed on \n\n to him in the trite words IN TANTO DISCRIMINE and he had tried to peer \n\n into the social life of the city of cities through the words IMPLERE \n\n OLLAM DENARIORUM which the rector had rendered sonorously as the \n\n filling of a pot with denaries. The pages of his time-worn Horace never \n\n felt cold to the touch even when his own fingers were cold; they were \n\n human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human \n\n fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm \n\n Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and, even \n\n for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses were as fragrant as \n\n though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and \n\n vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a \n\n shy guest at the feast of the world's culture and that the monkish \n\n learning, in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic \n\n philosophy, was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle \n\n and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry. \n\n  \n\n The grey block of Trinity on his left, set heavily in the city's \n\n ignorance like a dull stone set in a cumbrous ring, pulled his mind \n",

      "text": "from the fetters of the reformed conscience he came upon the droll \n\n statue of the national poet of Ireland. \n\n  \n\n He looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the \n\n soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up \n\n the folds of the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly \n\n conscious of its indignity. It was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a \n\n Milesian; and he thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It \n\n was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it \n\n lightly: \n\n  \n\n --Go on, Stevie, I have a hard head, you tell me. Call me what you \n\n will. \n\n  \n\n The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had \n\n touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in \n\n speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's \n\n rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's well-made boots \n\n that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's \n\n simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of \n\n his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener \n\n had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a \n\n quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English \n\n speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skill--for Davin \n\n had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gael--repelling swiftly and \n\n suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or \n\n by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving \n\n Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear. \n\n  \n\n Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle Mat \n\n Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend \n\n of Ireland. The gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render \n\n the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of \n\n him as a young fenian. His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his \n\n rude imagination by the broken lights of Irish myth. He stood towards \n\n the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of \n\n beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against themselves as \n\n they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the Roman \n\n catholic religion, the attitude of a dull-witted loyal serf. Whatsoever \n\n of thought or of feeling came to him from England or by way of English \n\n culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of \n\n the world that lay beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of \n\n France in which he spoke of serving. \n\n  \n\n Coupling this ambition with the young man's humour Stephen had often \n\n called him one of the tame geese and there was even a point of \n\n irritation in the name pointed against that very reluctance of speech \n\n and deed in his friend which seemed so often to stand between Stephen's \n\n mind, eager of speculation, and the hidden ways of Irish life. \n\n  \n\n One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or \n\n luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence of \n\n intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange \n\n vision. The two were walking slowly towards Davin's rooms through the \n\n dark narrow streets of the poorer jews. \n\n  \n\n --A thing happened to myself, Stevie, last autumn, coming on winter, \n\n and I never told it to a living soul and you are the first person now I \n\n ever told it to. I disremember if it was October or November. It was \n\n October because it was before I came up here to join the matriculation \n\n class. \n\n  \n\n Stephen had turned his smiling eyes towards his friend's face, \n\n flattered by his confidence and won over to sympathy by the speaker's \n\n simple accent. \n\n  \n\n --I was away all that day from my own place over in Buttevant. \n\n  \n\n --I don't know if you know where that is--at a hurling match between \n\n the Croke's Own Boys and the Fearless Thurles and by God, Stevie, that \n\n was the hard fight. My first cousin, Fonsy Davin, was stripped to his \n\n buff that day minding cool for the Limericks but he was up with the \n\n forwards half the time and shouting like mad. I never will forget that \n\n day. One of the Crokes made a woeful wipe at him one time with his \n\n caman and I declare to God he was within an aim's ace of getting it at \n\n the side of his temple. Oh, honest to God, if the crook of it caught \n\n him that time he was done for. \n\n  \n\n --I am glad he escaped, Stephen had said with a laugh, but surely \n\n that's not the strange thing that happened you?--Well, I suppose that \n\n doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the \n\n match that I missed the train home and I couldn't get any kind of a \n\n yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass \n\n meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the \n\n country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night \n\n or to foot it out. Well, I started to walk and on I went and it was \n\n coming on night when I got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better \n\n than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after \n\n that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or \n\n hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twice I stopped by the \n\n way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thick I'd \n\n have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road, \n\n I spied a little cottage with a light in the window. I went up and \n\n knocked at the door. A voice asked who was there and I answered I was \n\n over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and that I'd be \n\n thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the \n\n door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if \n\n she was going to bed when I knocked and she had her hair hanging and I \n\n thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she \n\n must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, \n\n and I thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were \n\n bare. She asked me was I tired and would I like to stop the night \n\n there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had \n\n gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all \n\n the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and \n\n she stood so close to me I could hear her breathing. When I handed her \n\n back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold \n\n and said: `COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE \n\n FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES.' I didn't go in, \n\n Stevie. I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the \n\n first bend of the road I looked back and she was standing at the door. \n\n  \n\n The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory and the figure of \n\n the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the \n\n peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as the \n\n college cars drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like \n\n soul waking to the consciousness of itself in darkness and secrecy and \n\n loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman \n\n without guile, calling the stranger to her bed. \n\n  \n\n A hand was laid on his arm and a young voice cried: \n\n  \n\n --Ah, gentleman, your own girl, sir! The first handsel today, gentleman. \n\n Buy that lovely bunch. Will you, gentleman? \n\n  \n\n The blue flowers which she lifted towards him and her young blue eyes \n\n seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness, and he halted \n\n till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp \n\n coarse hair and hoydenish face. \n\n  \n\n --Do, gentleman! Don't forget your own girl, sir! \n\n  \n\n --I have no money, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Buy them lovely ones, will you, sir? Only a penny. \n\n  \n\n --Did you hear what I said? asked Stephen, bending towards her. \n\n  \n\n I told you I had no money. I tell you again now. \n\n  \n\n --Well, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl answered \n\n after an instant. \n\n  \n\n --Possibly, said Stephen, but I don't think it likely. \n\n  \n\n --He left her quickly, fearing that her intimacy might turn to jibing \n\n and wishing to be out of the way before she offered her ware to \n\n another, a tourist from England or a student of Trinity. Grafton \n\n Street, along which he walked, prolonged that moment of discouraged \n\n poverty. In the roadway at the head of the street a slab was set to the \n\n memory of Wolfe Tone and he remembered having been present with his \n\n father at its laying. He remembered with bitterness that scene of \n\n tawdry tribute. There were four French delegates in a brake and one, a \n\n plump smiling young man, held, wedged on a stick, a card on which were \n\n printed the words: VIVE L'IRLANDE! \n\n  \n\n But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and the \n\n rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a faint incense rising \n\n upward through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant \n\n venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a \n\n faint mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment \n\n when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a \n\n corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley. \n\n  \n\n It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall \n\n and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The \n\n corridor was dark and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that \n\n it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck \n\n Whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit \n\n house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of \n\n Tone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space. \n\n  \n\n He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey light \n\n that struggled through the dusty windows. A figure was crouching before \n\n the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was \n\n the dean of studies lighting the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly \n\n and approached the fireplace. \n\n  \n\n --Good morning, sir! Can I help you? \n\n  \n\n The priest looked up quickly and said: \n\n  \n\n --One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an art in \n\n lighting a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. \n\n This is one of the useful arts. \n\n  \n\n --I will try to learn it, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Not too much coal, said the dean, working briskly at his task, that \n\n is one of the secrets. \n\n  \n\n He produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and \n\n placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched \n\n him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and \n\n busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he \n\n seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of \n\n sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's \n\n robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure \n\n of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and \n\n trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lord--in \n\n tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in \n\n waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when bidden--and yet had \n\n remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his \n\n very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards light \n\n and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctity--a \n\n mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than \n\n was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, \n\n greyed with a silver-pointed down. \n\n  \n\n The dean rested back on his hunkers and watched the sticks catch. \n\n Stephen, to fill the silence, said: \n\n  \n\n --I am sure I could not light a fire. \n\n  \n\n --You are an artist, are you not, Mr Dedalus? said the dean, glancing \n\n up and blinking his pale eyes. The object of the artist is the creation \n\n of the beautiful. What the beautiful is is another question. \n\n  \n\n He rubbed his hands slowly and drily over the difficulty. \n\n  \n\n --Can you solve that question now? he asked. \n\n  \n\n --Aquinas, answered Stephen, says PULCRA SUNT QUAE VISA PLACENT. \n\n  \n\n --This fire before us, said the dean, will be pleasing to the eye. \n\n Will it therefore be beautiful? \n\n  \n\n --In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, which I suppose means \n\n here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also says \n\n BONUM EST IN QUOD TENDIT APPETITUS. In so far as it satisfies the \n\n animal craving for warmth fire is a good. In hell, however, it is an \n\n evil. \n\n  \n\n --Quite so, said the dean, you have certainly hit the nail on the head. \n\n  \n\n He rose nimbly and went towards the door, set it ajar and said: \n\n  \n\n --A draught is said to be a help in these matters. \n\n  \n\n As he came back to the hearth, limping slightly but with a brisk step, \n\n Stephen saw the silent soul of a jesuit look out at him from the pale \n\n loveless eyes. Like Ignatius he was lame but in his eyes burned no \n\n spark of Ignatius's enthusiasm. Even the legendary craft of the \n\n company, a craft subtler and more secret than its fabled books of \n\n secret subtle wisdom, had not fired his soul with the energy of \n\n apostleship. It seemed as if he used the shifts and lore and cunning of \n\n the world, as bidden to do, for the greater glory of God, without joy \n\n in their handling or hatred of that in them which was evil but turning \n\n them, with a firm gesture of obedience back upon themselves and for all \n\n this silent service it seemed as if he loved not at all the master and \n\n little, if at all, the ends he served. SIMILITER ATQUE SENIS BACULUS, \n\n he was, as the founder would have had him, like a staff in an old man's \n\n hand, to be leaned on in the road at nightfall or in stress of weather, \n\n to lie with a lady's nosegay on a garden seat, to be raised in menace. \n\n  \n\n The dean returned to the hearth and began to stroke his chin. \n\n  \n\n --When may we expect to have something from you on the esthetic \n\n question? he asked. \n\n  \n\n --From me! said Stephen in astonishment. I stumble on an idea once a \n\n fortnight if I am lucky. \n\n  \n\n --These questions are very profound, Mr Dedalus, said the dean. It is \n\n like looking down from the cliffs of Moher into the depths. Many go \n\n down into the depths and never come up. Only the trained diver can go \n\n down into those depths and explore them and come to the surface again. \n\n  \n\n --If you mean speculation, sir, said Stephen, I also am sure that \n\n there is no such thing as free thinking inasmuch as all thinking must \n\n be bound by its own laws. \n\n  \n\n --Ha! \n\n  \n\n --For my purpose I can work on at present by the light of one or two \n\n ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas. \n\n  \n\n --I see. I quite see your point. \n\n  \n\n --I need them only for my own use and guidance until I have done \n\n something for myself by their light. If the lamp smokes or smells I \n\n shall try to trim it. If it does not give light enough I shall sell it \n\n and buy another. \n\n  \n\n --Epictetus also had a lamp, said the dean, which was sold for a fancy \n\n price after his death. It was the lamp he wrote his philosophical \n\n dissertations by. You know Epictetus? \n\n  \n\n --An old gentleman, said Stephen coarsely, who said that the soul is \n\n very like a bucketful of water. \n\n  \n\n --He tells us in his homely way, the dean went on, that he put an iron \n\n lamp before a statue of one of the gods and that a thief stole the \n\n lamp. What did the philosopher do? He reflected that it was in the \n\n character of a thief to steal and determined to buy an earthen lamp \n\n next day instead of the iron lamp. \n\n  \n\n A smell of molten tallow came up from the dean's candle butts and fused \n\n itself in Stephen's consciousness with the jingle of the words, bucket \n\n and lamp and lamp and bucket. The priest's voice, too, had a hard \n\n jingling tone. Stephen's mind halted by instinct, checked by the \n\n strange tone and the imagery and by the priest's face which seemed like \n\n an unlit lamp or a reflector hung in a false focus. What lay behind it \n\n or within it? A dull torpor of the soul or the dullness of the \n\n thundercloud, charged with intellection and capable of the gloom of \n\n God? \n\n  \n\n --I meant a different kind of lamp, sir, said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Undoubtedly, said the dean. \n\n  \n\n --One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know \n\n whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or \n\n according to the tradition of the marketplace. I remember a sentence of \n\n Newman's in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detained \n\n in the full company of the saints. The use of the word in the \n\n marketplace is quite different. I HOPE I AM NOT DETAINING YOU. \n\n  \n\n --Not in the least, said the dean politely. \n\n  \n\n --No, no, said Stephen, smiling, I mean-- \n\n  \n\n --Yes, yes; I see, said the dean quickly, I quite catch the point: \n\n DETAIN. \n\n  \n\n He thrust forward his under jaw and uttered a dry short cough. \n\n  \n\n --To return to the lamp, he said, the feeding of it is also a nice \n\n problem. You must choose the pure oil and you must be careful when you \n\n pour it in not to overflow it, not to pour in more than the funnel can \n\n hold. \n\n  \n\n --What funnel? asked Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --The funnel through which you pour the oil into your lamp. \n\n  \n\n --That? said Stephen. Is that called a funnel? Is it not a tundish? \n\n  \n\n --What is a tundish? \n\n  \n\n --That. Thefunnel. \n\n  \n\n --Is that called a tundish in Ireland? asked the dean. I never heard \n\n the word in my life. \n\n  \n\n --It is called a tundish in Lower Drumcondra, said Stephen, laughing, \n\n where they speak the best English. \n\n  \n\n --A tundish, said the dean reflectively. That is a most interesting \n\n word. I must look that word up. Upon my word I must. \n\n  \n\n His courtesy of manner rang a little false and Stephen looked at the \n\n English convert with the same eyes as the elder brother in the parable \n\n may have turned on the prodigal. A humble follower in the wake of \n\n clamorous conversions, a poor Englishman in Ireland, he seemed to have \n\n entered on the stage of jesuit history when that strange play of \n\n intrigue and suffering and envy and struggle and indignity had been all \n\n but given through--a late-comer, a tardy spirit. From what had he set \n\n out? Perhaps he had been born and bred among serious dissenters, seeing \n\n salvation in Jesus only and abhorring the vain pomps of the \n\n establishment. Had he felt the need of an implicit faith amid the \n\n welter of sectarianism and the jargon of its turbulent schisms, six \n\n principle men, peculiar people, seed and snake baptists, supralapsarian \n\n dogmatists? Had he found the true church all of a sudden in winding up \n\n to the end like a reel of cotton some fine-spun line of reasoning upon \n\n insufflation on the imposition of hands or the procession of the Holy \n\n Ghost? Or had Lord Christ touched him and bidden him follow, like that \n\n disciple who had sat at the receipt of custom, as he sat by the door of \n\n some zinc-roofed chapel, yawning and telling over his church pence? \n\n  \n\n The dean repeated the word yet again. \n\n  \n\n --Tundish! Well now, that is interesting! \n\n  \n\n --The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting. \n\n What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of \n\n earth, said Stephen coldly. \n\n  \n\n --The little word seemed to have turned a rapier point of his \n\n sensitiveness against this courteous and vigilant foe. He felt with a \n\n smart of dejection that the man to whom he was speaking was a \n\n countryman of Ben Jonson. He thought: \n\n  \n\n --The language in which we are speaking is his before it is mine. How \n\n different are the words HOME, CHRIST, ALE, MASTER, on his lips and on \n\n mine! I cannot speak or write these words without unrest of spirit. His \n\n language, so familiar and so foreign, will always be for me an acquired \n\n speech. I have not made or accepted its words. My voice holds them at \n\n bay. My soul frets in the shadow of his language. \n\n  \n\n --And to distinguish between the beautiful and the sublime, the dean \n\n added, to distinguish between moral beauty and material beauty. And to \n\n inquire what kind of beauty is proper to each of the various arts. \n\n These are some interesting points we might take up. \n\n  \n\n Stephen, disheartened suddenly by the dean's firm, dry tone, was \n\n silent; and through the silence a distant noise of many boots and \n\n confused voices came up the staircase. \n\n  \n\n --In pursuing these speculations, said the dean conclusively, there \n\n is, however, the danger of perishing of inanition. First you must take \n\n your degree. Set that before you as your first aim. Then, little by \n\n little, you will see your way. I mean in every sense, your way in life \n\n and in thinking. It may be uphill pedalling at first. Take Mr Moonan. \n\n He was a long time before he got to the top. But he got there. \n\n  \n\n --I may not have his talent, said Stephen quietly. \n\n  \n\n --You never know, said the dean brightly. We never can say what is in \n\n us. I most certainly should not be despondent. PER ASPERA AD ASTRA. \n\n  \n\n He left the hearth quickly and went towards the landing to oversee the \n\n arrival of the first arts' class. \n\n  \n\n Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and \n\n impartially every Student of the class and could almost see the frank \n\n smiles of the coarser students. A desolating pity began to fall like \n\n dew upon his easily embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of \n\n the knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal \n\n than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he \n\n would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and \n\n his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of \n\n the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during \n\n all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the lax \n\n and the lukewarm and the prudent. \n\n  \n\n The entry of the professor was signalled by a few rounds of Kentish \n\n fire from the heavy boots of those students who sat on the highest tier \n\n of the gloomy theatre under the grey cobwebbed windows. The calling of \n\n the roll began and the responses to the names were given out in all \n\n tones until the name of Peter Byrne was reached. \n\n  \n\n --Here! \n\n  \n\n A deep bass note in response came from the upper tier, followed by \n\n coughs of protest along the other benches. \n\n  \n\n The professor paused in his reading and called the next name: \n\n  \n\n --Cranly! \n\n  \n\n No answer. \n\n  \n\n --Mr Cranly! \n\n  \n\n A smile flew across Stephen's face as he thought of his friend's \n\n studies. \n\n  \n\n --Try Leopardstown! Said a voice from the bench behind. Stephen \n\n glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the grey \n\n light, was impassive. A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of the \n\n notebooks Stephen turned back again and said: \n\n  \n\n --Give me some paper for God's sake. \n\n  \n\n Are you as bad as that? asked Moynihan with a broad grin. \n\n  \n\n He tore a sheet from his scribbler and passed it down, whispering: \n\n  \n\n --In case of necessity any layman or woman can do it. \n\n  \n\n The formula which he wrote obediently on the sheet of paper, the \n\n coiling and uncoiling calculations of the professor, the spectre-like \n\n symbols of force and velocity fascinated and jaded Stephen's mind. He \n\n had heard some say that the old professor was an atheist freemason. O \n\n the grey dull day! It seemed a limbo of painless patient consciousness \n\n through which souls of mathematicians might wander, projecting long \n\n slender fabrics from plane to plane of ever rarer and paler twilight, \n\n radiating swift eddies to the last verges of a universe ever vaster, \n\n farther and more impalpable. \n\n  \n\n --So we must distinguish between elliptical and ellipsoidal. Perhaps some \n\n of you gentlemen may be familiar with the works of Mr W. S. Gilbert. In \n\n one of his songs he speaks of the billiard sharp who is condemned to \n\n play: \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  On a cloth untrue \n\n  With a twisted cue \n\n  And elliptical billiard balls. \n\n  \n\n --He means a ball having the form of the ellipsoid of the principal \n\n axes of which I spoke a moment ago. \n\n  \n\n Moynihan leaned down towards Stephen's ear and murmured: \n\n  \n\n --What price ellipsoidal balls! chase me, ladies, I'm in the cavalry! \n\n  \n\n His fellow student's rude humour ran like a gust through the cloister \n\n of Stephen's mind, shaking into gay life limp priestly vestments that \n\n hung upon the walls, setting them to sway and caper in a sabbath of \n\n misrule. The forms of the community emerged from the gust-blown \n\n vestments, the dean of studies, the portly florid bursar with his cap \n\n of grey hair, the president, the little priest with feathery hair who \n\n wrote devout verses, the squat peasant form of the professor of \n\n economics, the tall form of the young professor of mental science \n\n discussing on the landing a case of conscience with his class like a \n\n giraffe cropping high leafage among a herd of antelopes, the grave \n\n troubled prefect of the sodality, the plump round-headed professor of \n\n Italian with his rogue's eyes. They came ambling and stumbling, \n\n tumbling and capering, kilting their gowns for leap frog, holding one \n\n another back, shaken with deep false laughter, smacking one another \n\n behind and laughing at their rude malice, calling to one another by \n\n familiar nicknames, protesting with sudden dignity at some rough usage, \n\n whispering two and two behind their hands. \n\n  \n\n The professor had gone to the glass cases on the side wall, from a \n\n shelf of which he took down a set of coils, blew away the dust from \n\n many points and, bearing it carefully to the table, held a finger on it \n\n while he proceeded with his lecture. He explained that the wires in \n\n modern coils were of a compound called platinoid lately discovered by \n\n F. W. Martino. \n\n  \n\n He spoke clearly the initials and surname of the discoverer. Moynihan \n\n whispered from behind: \n\n  \n\n --Good old Fresh Water Martin! \n\n  \n\n --Ask him, Stephen whispered back with weary humour, if he wants a \n\n subject for electrocution. He can have me. \n\n  \n\n Moynihan, seeing the professor bend over the coils, rose in his bench \n\n and, clacking noiselessly the fingers of his right hand, began to call \n\n with the voice of a slobbering urchin. \n\n  \n\n --Please teacher! This boy is after saying a bad word, teacher. \n\n  \n\n --Platinoid, the professor said solemnly, is preferred to German \n\n silver because it has a lower coefficient of resistance by changes of \n\n temperature. The platinoid wire is insulated and the covering of silk \n\n that insulates it is wound on the ebonite bobbins just where my finger \n\n is. If it were wound single an extra current would be induced in the \n\n coils. The bobbins are saturated in hot paraffin wax \n\n  \n\n A sharp Ulster voice said from the bench below Stephen: \n\n  \n\n --Are we likely to be asked questions on applied science? \n\n  \n\n The professor began to juggle gravely with the terms pure science and \n\n applied science. A heavy-built student, wearing gold spectacles, stared \n\n with some wonder at the questioner. Moynihan murmured from behind in \n\n his natural voice: \n\n  \n\n --Isn't MacAlister a devil for his pound of flesh? \n\n  \n\n Stephen looked coldly on the oblong Skull beneath him overgrown with \n\n tangled twine-coloured hair. The voice, the accent, the mind of the \n\n questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards \n\n wilful unkindness, bidding his mind think that the student's father \n\n would have done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have \n\n saved something on the train fare by so doing. \n\n  \n\n The oblong skull beneath did not turn to meet this shaft of thought and \n\n yet the shaft came back to its bowstring; for he saw in a moment the \n\n student's whey-pale face. \n\n  \n\n --That thought is not mine, he said to himself quickly. It came from \n\n the comic Irishman in the bench behind. Patience. Can you Say with \n\n certitude by whom the soul of your race was bartered and its elect \n\n betrayed--by the questioner or by the mocker? Patience. Remember \n\n Epictetus. It is probably in his character to ask such a question at \n\n such a moment in such a tone and to pronounce the word SCIENCE as a \n\n monosyllable. \n\n  \n\n The droning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly \n\n round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling \n\n its somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance. \n\n  \n\n Moynihan's voice called from behind in echo to a distant bell: \n\n  \n\n --Closing time, gents! \n\n  \n\n The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a table near the \n\n door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of \n\n paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures. MacCann went briskly to \n\n and fro among the students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and \n\n leading one after another to the table. In the inner hall the dean of \n\n studies stood talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely \n\n and nodding his head. \n\n  \n\n Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From \n\n under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's dark eyes were \n\n watching him. \n\n  \n\n --Have you signed? Stephen asked. \n\n  \n\n Cranly closed his long thin-lipped mouth, communed with himself an \n\n instant and answered: \n\n  \n\n --EGO HABEO. \n\n  \n\n --What is it for? \n\n  \n\n --QUOD? \n\n  \n\n --What is it for? \n\n  \n\n Cranly turned his pale face to Stephen and said blandly and bitterly: \n\n  \n\n --PER PAX UNIVERSALIS. \n\n  \n\n --Stephen pointed to the Tsar's photograph and said: \n\n  \n\n --He has the face of a besotted Christ. \n\n  \n\n The scorn and anger in his voice brought Cranly's eyes back from a calm \n\n survey of the walls of the hall. \n\n  \n\n --Are you annoyed? he asked. \n\n  \n\n --No, answered Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Are you in bad humour? \n\n  \n\n --No. \n\n  \n\n --CREDO UT VOS SANGUINARIUS MENDAX ESTIS, said Cranly, QUIA FACIES \n\n VOSTRA MONSTRAT UT VOS IN DAMNO MALO HUMORE ESTIS. \n\n  \n\n Moynihan, on his way to the table, said in Stephen's ear: \n\n  \n\n --MacCann is in tiptop form. Ready to shed the last drop. Brand new \n\n world. No stimulants and votes for the bitches. \n\n  \n\n Stephen smiled at the manner of this confidence and, when Moynihan had \n\n passed, turned again to meet Cranly's eyes. \n\n  \n\n --Perhaps you can tell me, he said, why he pours his soul so freely \n\n into my ear. Can you? \n\n  \n\n A dull scowl appeared on Cranly's forehead. He stared at the table \n\n where Moynihan had bent to write his name on the roll, and then said \n\n flatly: \n\n  \n\n --A sugar! \n\n  \n\n --QUIS EST IN MALO HUMORE, said Stephen, EGO AUT VOS? \n\n  \n\n Cranly did not take up the taunt. He brooded sourly on his judgement \n\n and repeated with the same flat force: \n\n  \n\n --A flaming bloody sugar, that's what he is! \n\n  \n\n It was his epitaph for all dead friendships and Stephen wondered \n\n whether it would ever be spoken in the same tone over his memory. The \n\n heavy lumpish phrase sank slowly out of hearing like a stone through a \n\n quagmire. Stephen saw it sink as he had seen many another, feeling its \n\n heaviness depress his heart. Cranly's speech, unlike that of Davin, had \n\n neither rare phrases of Elizabethan English nor quaintly turned \n\n versions of Irish idioms. Its drawl was an echo of the quays of Dublin \n\n given back by a bleak decaying seaport, its energy an echo of the \n\n sacred eloquence of Dublin given back flatly by a Wicklow pulpit. \n\n  \n\n The heavy scowl faded from Cranly's face as MacCann marched briskly \n\n towards them from the other side of the hall. \n\n  \n\n --Here you are! said MacCann cheerily. \n\n  \n\n --Here I am! said Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --Late as usual. Can you not combine the progressive tendency with a \n\n respect for punctuality? \n\n  \n\n --That question is out of order, said Stephen. Next business. His \n\n smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate \n\n which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket. A little ring of \n\n listeners closed round to hear the war of wits. A lean student with \n\n olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing \n\n from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each \n\n flying phrase in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball \n\n from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over. \n\n  \n\n --Next business? said MacCann. Hom! \n\n  \n\n He gave a loud cough of laughter, smiled broadly and tugged twice at \n\n the straw-coloured goatee which hung from his blunt chin. \n\n  \n\n --The next business is to sign the testimonial. \n\n  \n\n --Will you pay me anything if I sign? asked Stephen. \n\n  \n\n --I thought you were an idealist, said MacCann. \n\n\n\n The gipsy-like student looked about him and addressed the onlookers in \n\n an indistinct bleating voice. \n\n  \n\n --By hell, that's a queer notion. I consider that notion to be a \n\n mercenary notion. \n\n  \n\n His voice faded into silence. No heed was paid to his words. He turned \n\n his olive face, equine in expression, towards Stephen, inviting him to \n\n speak again. \n\n  \n\n MacCann began to speak with fluent energy of the Tsar's rescript, of \n\n Stead, of general disarmament arbitration in cases of international \n\n disputes, of the signs of the times, of the new humanity and the new \n\n gospel of life which would make it the business of the community to \n\n secure as cheaply as possible the greatest possible happiness of the \n\n greatest possible number. \n\n  \n\n The gipsy student responded to the close of the period by crying: \n\n  \n\n --Three cheers for universal brotherhood! \n\n  \n\n --Go on, Temple, said a stout ruddy student near him. I'll stand you a \n\n pint after. \n\n  \n\n --I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, glancing about \n\n him out of his dark oval eyes. Marx is only a bloody cod. \n\n  \n\n Cranly gripped his arm tightly to check his tongue, smiling uneasily, \n\n and repeated: \n\n  \n\n --Easy, easy, easy! \n\n  \n\n Temple struggled to free his arm but continued, his mouth flecked by a \n\n thin foam: \n\n  \n\n --Socialism was founded by an Irishman and the first man in Europe who",
